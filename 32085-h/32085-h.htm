<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Friends</span>, who have wandered with me
through England, and Scotland, and old New
York, come now to Fife, and I will tell you
the story of Christina Ruleson, who lived in the
little fishing village of Culraine, seventy years ago.
You will not find Culraine on the map, though it
is one of that chain of wonderful little towns and
villages which crown, as with a diadem, the forefront
and the sea-front of the ancient kingdom of
Fife. Most of these towns have some song or
story, with which they glorify themselves, but Culraine&mdash;hidden
in the clefts of her sea-girt rocks&mdash;was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
<i>in</i> the world, but not <i>of</i> the world. Her people
lived between the sea and the sky, between their
hard lives on the sea, and their glorious hopes of
a land where there would be &#8220;no more sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seventy years ago every man in Culraine was a
fisherman, a mighty, modest, blue-eyed Goliath, with
a serious, inscrutable face; naturally a silent man,
and instinctively a very courteous one. He was
exactly like his great-grandfathers, he had the same
fishing ground, the same phenomena of tides and
winds, the same boat of rude construction, and the
same implements for its management. His modes
of thought were just as stationary. It took the
majesty of the Free Kirk Movement, and its host
of self-sacrificing clergy, to rouse again that passion
of religious faith, which made him the most
thorough and determined of the followers of John
Knox.</p>
<p>The women of these fishermen were in many
respects totally unlike the men. They had a character
of their own, and they occupied a far more
prominent position in the village than the men
did. They were the agents through whom all sales
were effected, and all the money passed through
their hands. They were talkative, assertive, bustling,
and a marked contrast to their gravely silent
husbands.</p>
<p>The Fife fisherman dresses very much like a
sailor&mdash;though he never looks like one&mdash;but the Fife
fisher-wife had then a distinctly foreign look. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
delighted in the widest stripes, and the brightest
colors. Flaunting calicoes and many-colored kerchiefs
were her steady fashion. Her petticoats were
very short, her feet trigly shod, and while unmarried
she wore a most picturesque headdress of
white muslin or linen, set a little backward over
her always luxuriant hair. Even in her girlhood
she was the epitome of power and self-reliance, and
the husband who could prevent her in womanhood
from making the bargains and handling the money,
must have been an extraordinarily clever man.</p>
<p>I find that in representing a certain class of humanity,
I have accurately described, mentally and
physically, the father and mother of my heroine;
and it is only necessary to say further that James
Ruleson was a sternly devout man. He trusted
God heartily at all hazards, and submitted himself
and all he loved to the Will of God, with that
complete self-abnegation which is perhaps one of
the best fruits of a passionate Calvinism.</p>
<p>For a fisherman he was doubtless well-provided,
but no one but his wife, Margot Ruleson, knew
the exact sum of money lying to his credit in the
Bank of Scotland; and Margot kept such knowledge
strictly private. Ruleson owned his boat, and his
cottage, and both were a little better and larger
than the ordinary boat and cottage; while Margot
was a woman who could turn a penny ten times
over better than any other woman in the cottages
of Culraine. Ruleson also had been blessed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
six sons and one daughter, and with the exception
of the youngest, all the lads had served their time
in their father&#8217;s boat, and even the one daughter
was not excused a single duty that a fisher-girl ought
to do.</p>
<p>Culraine was not a pretty village, though its cottages
were all alike whitewashed outside, and roofed
with heather. They had but two rooms generally&mdash;a
but and a ben, with no passage between. The
majority were among the sand hills, but many were
built on the lofty, sea-lashed rocks. James Ruleson&#8217;s
stood on a wide shelf, too high up for the
highest waves, though they often washed away the
wall of the garden, where it touched the sandy
shore.</p>
<p>The house stood by itself. It had its own sea,
and its own sky, and its own garden, the latter
sloping in narrow, giddy paths to the very beach.
Sure feet were needed among its vegetables, and
its thickets of gooseberry and currant bushes, and
its straying tangles of blackberry vines. Round
the whole plot there was a low stone wall, covered
with wall-flowers, wild thyme, rosemary, and house-leek.</p>
<p>A few beds around the house held roses and lilies,
and other floral treasures, but these were so exclusively
Margot&#8217;s property, and Margot&#8217;s adoration,
that I do not think she would like me even to write
about them. Sometimes she put a rosebud in the
buttonhole of her husband&#8217;s Sunday coat, and sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
Christina had a similar favor, but Margot
was intimate with her flowers. She knew every one
by a special name, and she counted them every morning.
It really hurt her to cut short their beautiful
lives, and her eldest son Norman, after long experience
said: &#8220;If Mither cuts a flower, she&#8217;ll ill to live
wi&#8217;. I wouldna tine her good temper for a bit rosebud.
It&#8217;s a poor bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>One afternoon, early in the June of 1849, Christine
Ruleson walked slowly up the narrow, flowery
path of this mountain garden. She was heard before
she was seen, for she was singing an east coast
ballad, telling all the world around her, that she</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&mdash;Cast her line in Largo bay,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And fishes she caught nine;</p>
<p>Three to boil, and three to fry,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And three to bait the line.</p>
</div></div>
<p>So much she sang, and then she turned to the sea.
The boat of a solitary fisherman, and a lustrously
white bird, were lying quietly on the bay, close together,
and a large ship with all her sails set was
dropping lazily along to the south. For a few
moments she watched them, and then continued her
song.</p>
<p>She was tall and lovely, and browned and bloomed
in the fresh salt winds. Her hair had been <ins title='Was lossened'>loosened</ins>
by the breeze, and had partially escaped from her
cap. She had a broad, white brow, and the dark
blue eyes that dwelt beneath it were full of soul&mdash;not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
a cloud in them, only a soft, radiant light,
shaded by eyelids deeply fringed, and almost transparent&mdash;eyelids
that were eloquent&mdash;full of secrets.
Her mouth was beautiful, her lips made for loving
words&mdash;even little children wanted to kiss her. And
she lived the very life of the sea. Like it she was
subject to ebb and flow. Her love for it was perhaps
prenatal, it might even have driven her into
her present incarnation.</p>
<p>When she came to the top of the cliff, she turned
and gazed again at the sea. The sunshine then
fell all over her, and her dress came into notice.
It was simple enough, yet very effective&mdash;a white
fluted cap, lying well back on her bright, rippling
hair, long gold rings in her ears, and a vivid scarlet
kerchief over her shoulders. Her skirt was of wide
blue and gray stripes, but it was hardly noticeable,
for whoever looked in Christine&#8217;s face cared little
about her dress. He could never tell what she
wore.</p>
<p>As she stood in the sunshine, a young man ran
out of the house to meet her&mdash;a passing handsome
youth, with his heart in his eager face and outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine! Christine!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Where at
a&#8217; have you keepit yourself? I hae been watching
and waiting for you, these three hours past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cluny! You are crushing the bonnie flowers i&#8217;
my hands, and I&#8217;m no thanking you for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my puir heart! It is atween your twa
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
hands, and it&#8217;s crushing it you are, day after day.
Christine, it is most broke wi&#8217; the cruel grip o&#8217; longing
and loving&mdash;and not a word o&#8217; hope or love to
help it haud together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should learn seasonable times, Cluny. It&#8217;s
few lasses that can be bothered wi&#8217; lovers that come
sae early. Women folk hae their hands full o&#8217;
wark o&#8217; some kind, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, full o&#8217; flowers. They canna even find time
to gie the grip o&#8217; their hand to the lad that loves
them, maist to the death throe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not wanting any lad to love me to the death
throe, and I&#8217;m not believing them, when they talk
such-like nonsense. No indeed! The lad I love
must be full o&#8217; life and <i>forthput</i>. He must be able
to guide his boat, and throw and draw his nets single-handed&mdash;if
needs be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you so! I love you so! I can do nothing
else, Christine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Havers!</i> Love sweetens life, but it&#8217;s a long
way from being life itsel&#8217;. Many a man, and many
a woman, loses their love, but they dinna fling their
life awa&#8217; because o&#8217; that misfortune&mdash;unless they
have no kindred to love, and no God to fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell how it is, Christine. You never
were i&#8217; love, I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankfu&#8217; to say I never was; and from all
I see, and hear, I am led to believe that being in
love isna a superior state o&#8217; life. I&#8217;m just hoping
that what you ca&#8217; love isna of a catching quality.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish it was! Maybe then, you might catch love
from me. Oh Christine, give me a hope, dear lass.
I canna face life without it. &#8216;Deed I can not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might do such a thing. Whiles women-folk
are left to themsel&#8217;s, and then it goes ill wi&#8217; them;&#8221;
and she sighed and shook her head, as if she feared
such a possibility was within her own fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you mean? I&#8217;m seeking one word
o&#8217; kindness from you, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she looked at him, and she did not require
speech. Cluny dared to draw closer to her&mdash;to put
his arm round her waist&mdash;to whisper such alluring
words of love and promise, that she smiled and
gave him a flower, and finally thought she might&mdash;perhaps&mdash;sometime&mdash;learn
the lesson he would teach
her, for, &#8220;This warld is fu&#8217; o&#8217; maybe&#8217;s, Cluny,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and what&#8217;s the good o&#8217; being young, if
we dinna expect miracles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for no miracle, Christine. I&#8217;m asking
for what a man may win by a woman&#8217;s favor.
I hae loved you, Christine, since I was a bit laddie
o&#8217; seven years auld. I&#8217;ll love you till men carry
me to the kirk yard. I&#8217;d die for your love. I&#8217;d
live, and suffer a&#8217; things for it. Lassie! Dear, dear
lassie, dinna fling love like mine awa&#8217;. There&#8217;s
every gude in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt his heart throbbing in his words, but
ere she could answer them, her brother Neil called
her three times, in a voice that admitted of no delay.
&#8220;Good-by, Cluny!&#8221; she said hurriedly. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
ken Neil isna to be put off.&#8221; Then she was gone,
and Cluny, full of bewildered loving and anxious
feelings, rushed at headlong speed down the steep
and narrow garden path, to his grandmother&#8217;s cottage
on the sands.</p>
<p>Neil stood by a little pine table covered with
books and papers. He was nearly twenty-one years
old, and compared with his family was small in
stature, lightly built, and dark in complexion. His
hair was black, his eyes somberly gray, and full of
calculation. His nose, lean and sharp, indicated
selfish adherence to the realities of life, and the
narrow nostrils positively accused him of timidity
and caution. His mouth was firm and discreet.
Taken as a whole, his face was handsome, though
lean and thoughtful; but his manner was less pleasant.
It was that of a serious snob, who thinks
there is a destiny before him. He had been petted
and spoiled all his life long, and his speech and
conduct were full of the unpleasant survivals of this
treatment. It spoiled him, and grated on Christine&#8217;s
temperament, like grit in a fine salad.</p>
<p>He had never made a shilling in his life, he was
the gentleman of the family, elected by the family
to that position. In his boyhood he had been delicate,
and quite unfit for the rough labor of the boats,
but as he had developed an extraordinary love for
books and learning, the minister had advised his
dedication to the service of either the Law or the
Gospel. To this proposal the whole household
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
cheerfully, even proudly, agreed. To have an educated
man among the Rulesons pleased everyone.
They spoke together of the great Scotch chancellors,
and the great Scotch clergy, and looked upon Neil
Ruleson, by special choice and election, as destined
in the future to stand high among Scotland&#8217;s clergy
or Scotland&#8217;s lawyers.</p>
<p>For this end, during eleven years, all had given
their share without stint or holdback. That Neil
had finally chosen to become a Lord of the Law,
and to sit on the Bench, rather than stand in the
Pulpit, was a great disappointment to his father,
who had stubbornly hoped his son would get the
call no man can innocently refuse to answer. His
mother and brothers were satisfied. Norman Ruleson
had once seen the Lords ride in civic pomp and
splendid attire to Edinburgh Parliament House, and
he was never weary of describing the majesty of
the judges in their wigs and gowns, and the ceremonials
that attended every step of the administration
of justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the big salary coming to the judges!&#8221; Normany
always added&mdash;&#8220;the salary, and the visible
honors arena to be lightlied, or made little o&#8217;. Compared
wi&#8217; a minister&#8217;s stipend, a judge&#8217;s salary is
stin-pen-dous! And they go wi&#8217; the best i&#8217; the land,
and it isna anything o&#8217; a wonder, when a judge is
made a lord. There was Lord Chancellor Campbell,
born in Fife itsel&#8217;, in the vera county town
o&#8217; Cupar. I have seen the house next the Bell Inn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
where he was born, and his feyther was the minister
o&#8217; Cupar. About the year 18&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needna fash either us, or yoursel&#8217;, Norman,
wi&#8217; names and dates; it will be time in plenty, when
you can add our lad to the list.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot at this hour was inclined to side with
her husband. Margot believed in realities. She
saw continually the honorable condition of the Scotch
clergy; Norman&#8217;s story about the royal state and
power of the judges was like something read out
of a book. However, now that Neil was in his last
year of study, and looking forward to the certificate
which would place him among men in such a desirable
condition, she would not darken his hopes,
nor damp his ardor.</p>
<p>Neil&#8217;s classes in the Maraschal college at Aberdeen
were just closed, but he was very busy preparing
papers for their opening in September. This
was to be his final term, and he expected to deliver
a valedictory speech. The table in the best room,
which he was permitted to occupy as a study, was
covered with notes, which he wished copied&mdash;with
books from which he was anxious to recite&mdash;with
work of many kinds, which was waiting for Christine&#8217;s
clear brain and fine penmanship.</p>
<p>It had been waiting an hour and Neil was distinctly
angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother! Where at all is Christine?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She went to your brither Norman&#8217;s cottage. His
little lad isna as weel as he should be.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And my wark has to wait on a sick bairn. I&#8217;m
not liking it. And I have no doubt she is wasting
my time with Cluny McPherson&mdash;no doubt at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel! That circumstance isna likely to be far
out o&#8217; the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very far out of <i>my</i> way. I can tell you
that, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, lad, there&#8217;s no way always straight. It&#8217;s
right and left, and up and down, wi&#8217; every way o&#8217;
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so, Mother, but my work is waiting, and
it puts me out of the right way, entirely!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! tut! What are you complaining aboot?
The lassie has been at your beck and call the best
pairt o&#8217; her life. And it&#8217;s vera seldom she can
please you. If she gave you the whites o&#8217; her e&#8217;en,
you would still hae a grumble. It&#8217;s Saturday afternoon.
What&#8217;s your will sae late i&#8217; the week&#8217;s
wark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought I not to be at my studies, late and early?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That stands to reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, I want Christine&#8217;s help, and I am going
to call her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hae had her help ever sin&#8217; you learned
your A B C&#8217;s. She&#8217;s twa years younger than you
are, but she&#8217;s twa years ahead o&#8217; you in the ordinary
essentials. Do you think I didna tak&#8217; notice that
when she was hearing your tasks, she learned them
the while you were stumbling all the way through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
them. Dod! The lassie knew things if she only
looked in the face o&#8217; them twice o&#8217;er, and it took
you mair than an hour to get up to her&mdash;what you
ca&#8217; history, and ge-o-graph-y she learned as if they
were just a bairn&#8217;s bit rhyming, and she was as quick
wi&#8217; the slate and figures as you were slow. Are you
forgetting things like these?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not kind in you to be reminding me of them,
Mother. It is not like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One o&#8217; my duties to a&#8217; my men-folk, is to keep
them in mind o&#8217; the little bits o&#8217; kindness they are
apt to forget. Your feyther isna to mind, he ne&#8217;er
misses the least o&#8217; them. Your brother Norman is
like him, the rest o&#8217; you arena to lippen to&mdash;at a&#8217;
times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have helped Christine as much as she
has helped me. She knows that, she has often
said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant! It was womanlike! She said it
to mak&#8217; ye feel comfortable, when you o&#8217;erworked
her. Did ye ever say the like to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to call her. She is better with me
than with Cluny Macpherson&mdash;that I am sure of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and her for it. Settle the matter as it suits
ye, but I can tell ye, I hae been parfectly annoyed, on
several occasions, wi&#8217; your clear selfishness&mdash;and that
is the vera outcome o&#8217; all my thoughts on this subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Neil went to the door, and called Christine
thrice, and the power of long habit was ill to restrain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
so she left her lover hurriedly and went to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been watching and waiting&mdash;waiting for
you, Christine, the last three hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tak&#8217; tent o&#8217; what you say, Neil. It isna twa
hours yet, since we had dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have told me that you were intending
to fritter and fool your afternoon away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mither bid me go and speir after Norman&#8217;s
little laddie. He had a sair cold and fever, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down. Are your hands clean? I want you
to copy a very important paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What aboot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Differences in the English and Scotch Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hae anything to do wi&#8217; the Law.
I canna understand it, and I&#8217;m no wanting to understand
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary that you should understand
it, but you know what a peculiar writing comes from
my pen. I can manage Latin or Greek, but I cannot
write plainly the usual English. Now, you write
a clear, firm hand, and I want you to copy my important
papers. I believe I have lost honors at
college, just through my singular writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t wonder. It is mair like the marks
the robin&#8217;s wee feet make on the snow, than the
writing o&#8217; human hands. I wonder, too, if the
robin kens his ain footmarks, and if they mean anything
to him. Maybe they say, &#8216;It&#8217;s vera cold this
morning&mdash;and the ground is covered wi&#8217; snow&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
I&#8217;m vera hungry&mdash;hae ye anything for me this morning?&#8217;
The sma footmarks o&#8217; the wee birds might
mean all o&#8217; this, and mair too, Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense you are talking! Run away and
wash your hands. They are stained and soiled with
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wi&#8217; the wild thyme, and the rosemary, and the
wall-flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the rough, tarry hand of Cluny Macpherson.
Be quick! I am in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Saturday afternoon, Neil. Feyther and
Eneas will be up from the boats anon. I dinna care
to write for you, the now. Mither said I was to
please mysel&#8217; what I did, and I&#8217;m in the mind to
go and see Faith Balcarry, and hae a long crack wi&#8217;
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neil looked at her in astonishment. There was
a stubborn set to her lovely mouth, he had never
seen there before. It was a feminine variety of an
expression he understood well when he saw it on
his father&#8217;s lips. Immediately he changed his tactics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your eyes look luck on anything you write,
Christine, and you know how important these last
papers are to me&mdash;and to all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldna Monday suit them, just as weel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There will be others for Monday. I am
trusting to you, Christine. You always have helped
me. You are my Fail-Me-Never!&#8221;</p>
<p>She blushed and smiled with the pleasure this acknowledgment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
gave her, but she did not relinquish
her position. &#8220;I am vera sorry, Neil,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;but I dinna see how I can break my promise to
Faith Balcarry. You ken weel what a friendless
creature she is in this world. How could I disappoint
a lass whose cup is running o&#8217;er wi&#8217; sorrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make a bargain with you, Christine. I
will wait until Monday, if you will promise me to
keep Cluny Macpherson in his place. He has no
business making love to you, and I will make trouble
for him if he does so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you at Cluny? He is in feyther&#8217;s boat,
and like to stay there. Feyther trusts him, and
Eneas never has a word out o&#8217; the way with him,
and you ken that Eneas is often gey ill to wark wi&#8217;,
and vera demanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cluny Macpherson is all right in the boat, but
he is much out of his place holding your two hands,
and making love to you. I saw him doing it, not
ten minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cluny has made love to me a&#8217; his life lang.
There is nae harm in his love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no good in it. Just as soon as I am
one of Her Majesty&#8217;s Councilors at Law, I shall
take an office in the town, and rent a small floor,
and then I shall require you to keep house for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are running before you can creep, Neil.
How are you going to pay rents, and buy furnishings?
Forbye, I couldna leave Mither her lane.
She hasna been hersel&#8217; this year past, and whiles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
she has sair attacks that gie us all a fearsome day
or twa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither has had those attacks for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the more reason for us to be feared o&#8217; them.
Neil, I canna even think o&#8217; my life, wanting
Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you love <i>me</i>! I am bound to bring all kinds
o&#8217; good luck to our family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither is good luck hersel&#8217;. There would be
nae luck about the house, if Mither went awa&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, you will give Cluny up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna say that I will do anything o&#8217; that kind.
Every lass wants a lover, and I have nane but
Cluny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a grand one in view for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha may the lad be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend at the Maraschal. He is the young
Master of Brewster and Ballister, and as fine a
young fellow as walks in shoe leather. The old
Ballister mansion you must have seen every Sabbath,
as you went to the kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I hae seen the roof and turrets o&#8217; it, among
the thick woods; but naebody has lived there, since
I was born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, but Ballister is going to open the
place, and spend gold in its plenishing and furnishing.
It is a grand estate, and the young master
is worthy of it. I am his friend, and I mean to bring
you two together. You are bonnie, and he is rich;
it would be a proper match. I owe you something,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
Christine, and I&#8217;ll pay my debt with a husband
worthy of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how would I be worthy o&#8217; him? I hae
neither learning nor siller. You are talking foolishness,
Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not without learning. In my company
you must have picked up much information. You
could not hear my lessons and copy my exercises
without acquiring a knowledge of many things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, a smattering o&#8217; this and that. You wouldna
call that an education, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a better one than most girls get, that is,
in the verities and the essentials. The overcome is
only in the ornamentals, or accomplishments&mdash;piano-playing,
singing, dancing, and maybe what you call
a smattering of the French tongue. There is a piano
in Ballister, and you would pick out a Scotch song
in no time, for you sing <ins title='Was live'>like</ins> a mavis. As for dancing,
you foot it like a fairy, and a mouthful of
French words would be at your own desire or pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae that mouthfu&#8217; already. Did you think I
wrote book after book full o&#8217; your French exercises,
and heard you recite Ollendorf twice through, and
learned naething while I was doing it? Neil, I am
awa&#8217; to Faith, I canna possibly break my word to a
lass in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A moment, Christina&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I havna half a moment. I&#8217;ll do your writing
Monday, Neil.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Christine! Christine!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was beyond his call, and before he got over
his amazement, she was out of sight. Then his
first impulse was to go to his mother, but he remembered
that she had not been sympathetic when
he had before spoken of Christine and Cluny Macpherson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be wise, and take my own counsel,&#8221; he
thought, and he had no fear of wanting his own
sympathy; yet when he reviewed his conversation
with Christine, he was annoyed at its freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought not to have told her about Ballister,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;she will be watching for him at the kirk,
and looking at the towers o&#8217; Ballister House as if
they were her own. And whatever made me say
I thought of her as my housekeeper? She would be
the most imprudent person. I would have the whole
fishing-village at my house door, and very likely at
my fireside; and that would be a constant set-down
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This train of thought was capable of much discreet
consideration, and he pursued it until he heard
the stir of presence and conversation in the large
living room. Then he knew that his father and
brother were at home, to keep the preparation for
the Sabbath. So he made himself look as lawyer-like
as possible, and joined the family. Everyone,
and everything, had a semi-Sabbath look. Ruleson
was in a blue flannel suit, so was Eneas, and Margot
had put on a clean cap, and thrown over her shoulders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
a small tartan shawl. The hearth had been
rid up, and the table was covered with a clean white
cloth. In the oven the meat and pudding were cooking,
and there was a not unpleasant sancta-serious
air about the people, and the room. You might
have fancied that even the fishing nets hanging
against the wall knew it was Saturday night, and
no fishing on hand.</p>
<p>Christine was not there. And as it was only on
Saturday and Sunday nights that James Ruleson
could be the priest of his family, these occasions were
precious to him, and he was troubled if any of his
family were absent. Half an hour before Christine
returned home, he was worrying lest she forget the
household rite, and when she came in he asked her,
for the future, to bide at home on Saturday and
Sabbath nights, saying he &#8220;didna feel all right,&#8221; unless
she was present.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was doing your will, Feyther, anent Faith Balcarry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you were doing right. How is the puir
lassie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s little to be done for her. She hasna a
hope left, and when I spoke to her anent heaven,
she said she knew nobody there, and the thought o&#8217;
the loneliness she would feel frightened her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, James,&#8221; said Margot, &#8220;puir Faith never
saw her father or mother, and if all accounts be
true, no great loss, and I dinna believe the lassie ever
knew anyone in this warld she would want to see in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
heaven. Nae wonder she is sae sad and lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the great multitude of saints there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gudeman, it is our ain folk we will be seeking,
and speiring after, in heaven. Without them, we
shall be as lonely as puir Faith, who knows no one
either in this world, or the next, that she&#8217;s caring
to see. I wouldn&#8217;t wonder, James, if heaven might
not feel lonely to those who win there, but find no
one they know to welcome them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are told we shall be satisfied, Margot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I hope sae! Come now, and we will
hae a gude dinner and eat it cheerfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>After dinner there was a pleasant evening during
which fishers and fishers&#8217; wives came in, and chatted
of the sea, and the boats, and the herring fishing
just at hand; but at ten o&#8217;clock the big Bible, bound
round with brass, covered with green baize, and
undivested of the Books of the Apocrypha, was
laid before the master. As he was trying to find
the place he wanted, Margot stepped behind him,
and looked over his shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gudeman,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;you needna be harmering
through thae chapters o&#8217; proper names, in
the Book o&#8217; Chronicles. The trouble is overganging
the profit. Read us one o&#8217; King David&#8217;s psalms or
canticles, then we&#8217;ll go to our sleep wi&#8217; a song in
our hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your will be it, Margot. Hae you any choice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was reading the seventy-first this afternoon,
and I could gladly hear it o&#8217;er again.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>And O how blessed is that sleep into which we
fall, hearing through the darkness and silence, the
happy soul recalling itself&mdash;&#8220;In thee, O Lord, do
I put my trust&mdash;Thou art my hope, O Lord God&mdash;my
trust from my youth&mdash;I will hope continually&mdash;and
praise Thee&mdash;more and more&mdash;my soul which
Thou hast&mdash;redeemed! Which Thou hast redeemed!&#8221;
With that wonderful thought falling off
into deep, sweet sleep&mdash;it might be into that mysteriously
conscious sleep, informed by prophesying
dreams, which is the walking of God through sleep.</p>

</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>I remember the black wharves and the boats,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And the sea tides tossing free;</p>
<p>And the fishermen with bearded lips,</p>
<p>And the beauty and mystery of the ships,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Domine is a good man. If you only meet him on

</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>One</span> day leads to another, and even in the
little, hidden-away village of Culraine, no
two days were exactly alike. Everyone was
indeed preparing for the great fishing season, and
looking anxiously for its arrival, but if all were
looking for the same event, it had for its outcome
in every heart a different end, or desire. Thus,
James Ruleson hoped its earnings would complete
the sum required to build a cottage for his daughter&#8217;s
marriage portion, and Margot wanted the
money, though not for the same object. Norman
had a big doctor&#8217;s bill to pay, and Eneas thought
of a two weeks&#8217; holiday, and a trip to Edinburgh
and Glasgow; while Neil was anxious about an increase
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
in his allowance. He had his plea all ready&mdash;he
wanted a new student&#8217;s gown of scarlet flannel,
and some law books, which, he said, everyone knew
were double the price of any other books. It was
his last session, and he did hope that he would be
let finish it creditably.</p>
<p>He talked to Christine constantly on the subject,
and she promised to stand up for the increase.
&#8220;Though you ken, Neil,&#8221; she added, &#8220;that you hae
had full thirty pounds a session, and that is a lot
for feyther to tak&#8217; out o&#8217; the sea; forbye Mither
was aye sending you a box full o&#8217; eggs and bacon,
and fish and oatmeal, ne&#8217;er forgetting the cake that
men-folk all seem sae extra fond o&#8217;. And you yoursel&#8217;
were often speaking o&#8217; the lads who paid their
fees and found their living out o&#8217; thirty pounds a
session. Isn&#8217;t that sae?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not deny the fact, but let me tell you how
they manage it. They have a breakfast of porridge
and milk, and then they are away for four hours&#8217;
Greek and Latin. Then they have two pennyworths
of haddock and a few potatoes for dinner, and back
to the college again, for more dead languages, and
mathematics. They come back to their bit room
in some poor, cold house, and if they can manage
it, have a cup of tea and some oat cake, and they
spend their evenings learning their lessons for the
next day, by the light of a tallow candle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are brave, good lads, and I dinna wonder
they win all, an&#8217; mair, than what they worked for.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
The lads o&#8217; Maraschal College are fine scholars,
and the vera pith o&#8217; men. The hard wark and
the frugality are good for them, and, Neil, we are
expecting you to be head and front among them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must have the books to help me there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That stands to reason; and if you&#8217;ll gie me your
auld gown, I&#8217;ll buy some flannel, and mak&#8217; you a
new one, just like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The college has its own tailor, Christine. I believe
the gowns are difficult to make. And what is
more, I shall be obligated to have a new kirk suit.
You see I go out with Ballister a good deal&mdash;very
best families and all that&mdash;and I must have the
clothes conforming to the company. Ballister
might&mdash;nae doubt would&mdash;lend me the money&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking anent? Borrowing is sorrowing,
aye and shaming, likewise. I&#8217;m fairly astonished
at you naming such a thing! If you are
put to a shift like that, Christine can let you hae the
price o&#8217; a suit o&#8217; clothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Christine, if you would do that, it would be
a great favor, and a great help to me. I&#8217;ll pay you
back, out of the first money I make. The price
o&#8217; the books I shall have to coax from Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll hae no obligation to trouble Mother. Ask
your feyther for the books you want. He would
be the vera last to grudge them to you. Speak to
him straight, and bold, and you&#8217;ll get the siller wi&#8217;
a smile and a good word.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If <i>you</i> would ask him for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you will, Christine. I have reasons for not
doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hae just one reason&mdash;simple cowardice. O
Man! If you are a coward anent asking a new suit
o&#8217; clothes for yoursel&#8217;, what kind o&#8217; a lawyer will
you mak&#8217; for ither folk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how Father is about giving money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Feyther earns his money wi&#8217; his life in his
hands. He wants to be sure the thing sought is
good and necessary. Feyther&#8217;s right. Now my
money was maistly gi&#8217;en me, I can mair easily risk
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no risk in my promise to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You havna any sure contract wi&#8217; Good Fortune,
Neil, and it will be good and bad wi&#8217; you, as it is
wi&#8217; ither folk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not approve of your remarks, Christine.
When people are talking of the fundamentals&mdash;and
surely money is one of them&mdash;they ought to avoid
irritating words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll mak&#8217; an extraordinar lawyer, if you do
that, but I&#8217;m no sure that you will win your case,
wanting them. I thought they were sort o&#8217; necessitated;
but crooked and straight is the law, and
it is well known that what it calls truth today, may
be far from truth tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you today, Christine? Has the law
injured you in any way?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay, it played us a&#8217; a trick. When you took up
the books, and went to the big school i&#8217; the toun
to prepare for Aberdeen, we all o&#8217; us thought it
was King&#8217;s College you were bound for, and then
when you were ready for Aberdeen, you turned
your back on King&#8217;s College, and went to the
Maraschal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;King&#8217;s College is for the theology students. The
Maraschal is the law school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that. We a&#8217; know it. The Maraschal
spelt a big disappointment to feyther and mysel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some work to finish, Christine, and I
will be under an obligation if you will leave me now.
You are in an upsetting temper, and I think you
have fairly forgotten yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m awa, but mind you! When the fishing
is on, I canna be at your bidding. I&#8217;m telling
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hae no time for you, and your writing. I&#8217;ll
be helping Mither wi&#8217; the fish, from the dawn to
the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I not?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was at the open door of the room as she
spoke, and Neil said with provoking indifference:
&#8220;If you are seeing Father, you might speak to him
anent the books I am needing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not do it! What are you feared for?
You&#8217;re parfectly unreasonable, parfectly ridic-lus!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
And she emphasized her assertions by her decided
manner of closing the door.</p>
<p>On going into the yard, she found her father
standing there, and he was looking gravely over
the sea. &#8220;Feyther!&#8221; she said, and he drew her close
to his side, and looked into her lovely face with a
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you watching for the fish, Feyther?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I am! They are long in coming this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every year they are long in coming. Perhaps
we are impatient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sae. We are a&#8217; ready for them&mdash;watching
for them&mdash;Cluny went to Cupar Head to watch.
He has a fine sea-sight. If they are within human
ken, he will spot them, nae doubt. What hae you
been doing a&#8217; the day lang?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae been writing for Neil. He is uncommon
anxious about this session, Feyther.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is requiring some expensive books, and he
is feared to name them to you; he thinks you hae
been sae liberal wi&#8217; him already&mdash;if I was you,
Feyther, I would be asking him&mdash;quietly when you
were by your twa sel&#8217;s&mdash;if he was requiring anything
i&#8217; the way o&#8217; books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has had a big sum for that purpose already,
Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Feyther, but I&#8217;m not needing to tell
you that a man must hae the tools his wark is requiring,
or he canna do it. If you set Neil to mak&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
a table, you&#8217;d hae to gie him the saw, and the hammer,
and the full wherewithals, for the makin&#8217; o&#8217; a
table; and when you are for putting him among
the Edinbro&#8217; Law Lords, you&#8217;ll hae to gie him the
books that can teach him their secrets. Isn&#8217;t that
fair, Feyther?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not denying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel then, you&#8217;ll do the fatherly thing, and seeing
the laddie is feared to ask you for the books,
you&#8217;ll ask him, &#8216;Are you wanting any books for the
finishing up, Neil?&#8217; You see it is just here, Feyther,
he could borrow the books&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang borrowing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sae, you are quite right, Feyther. Neil says
if he has to borrow, he&#8217;ll never get the book when
he wants it, and that he would never get leave to
keep it as long as he needed. Now Neil be to hae his
ain books, Feyther, he will mak&#8217; good use o&#8217; them,
and we must not fail him at the last hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;s talking o&#8217; failing him? Not his feyther,
I&#8217;m sure! Do I expect to catch herrings without
the nets and accessories? And I ken that I&#8217;ll not
mak&#8217; a lawyer o&#8217; Neil, without the Maraschal and
the books it calls for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the wisest and lovingest o&#8217; feythers.
When you meet Neil, and you twa are by yoursel&#8217;s,
put your hand on Neil&#8217;s shoulder, and ask Neil,
&#8216;Are you needing any books for your last lessons?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do as you say, dear lass. It is right I
should.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nay, but he should ask you to do it. If it was
mysel&#8217;, I could ask you for anything I ought to
have, but Neil is vera shy, and he kens weel how
hard you wark for your money. He canna bear to
speak o&#8217; his necessities, sae I&#8217;m speaking the word
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy word goes wi&#8217; me&mdash;always. I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er say
nay to thy yea,&#8221; and he clasped her hand, and
looked with a splendid smile of affection into her
beautiful face. An English father would have certainly
kissed her, but Scotch fathers rarely give this
token of affection. Christine did not expect it, unless
it was her birthday, or New Year&#8217;s morning.</p>
<p>It was near the middle of July, when the herring
arrived. Then early one day, Ruleson, watching
the sea, smote his hands triumphantly, and lifting
his cap with a shout of welcome, cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s our boat! Cluny is sailing her! He&#8217;s
bringing the news! They hae found the fish! Come
awa&#8217; to the pier to meet them, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>With hurrying steps they took the easier landward
side of descent, but when they reached the
pier there was already a crowd of men and women
there, and the <i>Sea Gull</i>, James Ruleson&#8217;s boat, was
making for it. She came in close-hauled to the wind,
with a double reef in her sail. She came rushing
across the bay, with the water splashing her gunwale.
Christine kept her eyes upon the lad at the
tiller, a handsome lad, tanned to the temples. His
cheeks were flushed, and the wind was in his hair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and the sunlight in his eyes, and he was steering
the big herring boat into the harbor.</p>
<p>The men were soon staggering down to the boats
with the nets, coiling them up in apparently endless
fashion, and as they were loaded they were
very hard to get into the boats, and harder still to
get out. Just as the sun began to set, the oars were
dipped, and the boats swept out of the harbor into
the bay, and there they set their red-barked sails,
and stood out for the open sea.</p>
<p>Ruleson&#8217;s boat led the way, because it was Ruleson&#8217;s
boat that had found the fish, and Christine
stood at the pier-edge cheering her strong, brave
father, and not forgetting a smile and a wave of her
hand for the handsome Cluny at the tiller. To her
these two represented the very topmost types of
brave and honorable humanity. The herring they
were seeking were easily found, for it was the Grand
Shoal, and it altered the very look of the ocean, as
it drove the water before it in a kind of flushing
ripple. Once, as the boats approached them, the
shoal sank for at least ten minutes, and then rose
in a body again, reflecting in the splendid sunset
marvelous colors and silvery sheen.</p>
<p>With a sweet happiness in her heart, Christine
went slowly home. She did not go into the village,
she walked along the shore, over the wet sands to
the little gate, which opened upon their garden.
On her way she passed the life-boat. It was in
full readiness for launching at a moment&#8217;s notice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
and she went close to it, and patted it on the bow,
just as a farmer&#8217;s daughter would pat the neck of
a favorite horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye hae saved the lives of men,&#8221; she said. &#8220;God
bless ye, boatie!&#8221; and she said it again, and then
stooped and looked at a little brass plate screwed
to the stern locker, on which were engraved these
words:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Put your trust in God,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And do your best.</p>
</div></div>
<p>And as she climbed the garden, she thought of
the lad who had left Culraine thirty years ago, and
gone to Glasgow to learn ship building, and who
had given this boat to his native village out of his
first savings. &#8220;And it has been a lucky boat,&#8221; she
said softly, &#8220;every year it has saved lives,&#8221; and
then she remembered the well-known melody, and
sang joyously&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Weel may the keel row,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And better may she speed,</p>
<p>Weel may the keel row,</p>
<p class='indent2'>That wins the bairnies&#8217; bread.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Weel may the keel row,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Amid the stormy strife,</p>
<p>Weel may the keel row</p>
<p class='indent2'>That saves the sailor&#8217;s life.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;God bless the Life-Boat!</p>
<p class='indent2'>In the stormy strife,</p>
<p>Saving drowning men,</p>
<p class='indent2'>On the seas o&#8217; Fife.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Weel may her keel row&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then with a merry, inward laugh she stopped, and
said with pretended displeasure: &#8220;Be quiet, Christine!
You&#8217;re makin&#8217; poetry again, and you shouldna
do the like o&#8217; that foolishness. Neil thinks it isna
becoming for women to mak&#8217; poetry&mdash;he says men
lose their good sense when they do it, and women!
He hadna the words for their shortcomings in the
matter. He could only glower and shake his head,
and look up at the ceiling, which he remarked needed
a coat o&#8217; clean lime and water. Weel, I suppose
Neil is right! There&#8217;s many a thing not becomin&#8217; to
women, and nae doubt makin&#8217; poetry up is among
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she entered the cottage, she found the
Domine, Dr. Magnus Trenabie, drinking a cup of
tea at the fireside. He had been to the pier to see
the boats sail, for all the men of his parish were
near and dear to him. He was an extraordinary
man&mdash;a scholar who had taken many degrees and
honors, and not exhausted his mental powers in
getting them&mdash;a calm, sabbatic mystic, usually so
quiet that his simple presence had a sacramental efficacy&mdash;a
man who never reasoned, being full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
faith; a man enlightened by his heart, not by his
brain.</p>
<p>Being spiritually of celestial race, he was lodged
in a suitable body. Its frame was Norse, its blood
Celtic. He appeared to be a small man, when he
stood among the gigantic fishermen who obeyed him
like little children, but he was really of average
height, graceful and slender. His head was remarkably
long and deep, his light hair straight and
fine. The expression of his face was usually calm
and still, perhaps a little cold, but there was every
now and then a look of flame. Spiritually, he had
a great, tender soul quite happy to dwell in a little
house. Men and women loved him, he was the
angel on the hearth of every home in Culraine.</p>
<p>When Christine entered the cottage, the atmosphere
of the sea was around and about her. The
salt air was in her clothing, the fresh wind in her
loosened hair, and she had a touch of its impetuosity
in the hurry of her feet, the toss of her manner,
the ring of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Mither!&#8221; she cried, then seeing the Domine,
she made a little curtsey, and spoke to him first. &#8220;I
was noticing you, Sir, among the men on the pier.
I thought you were going with them this night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have hard work this night, Christine, and
my heart tells me they will be wanting to say little
words they would not like me to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could hae corrected them, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not caring to correct them, tonight. Words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
often help work, and tired fishers, casting their
heavy nets overboard, don&#8217;t do that work without
a few words that help them. The words are not
sinful, but they might not say them if I was present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Sir,&#8221; answered Margot. &#8220;I hae a few
o&#8217; such words always handy. When I&#8217;m hurried
and flurried, I canna help them gettin&#8217; outside my
lips&mdash;but there&#8217;s nae ill in them&mdash;they just keep
me going. I wad gie up, wanting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When soldiers, Margot, are sent on a forlorn
hope of capturing a strong fort, they go up to it
cheering. When our men launch the big life-boat,
how do they do it, Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheering, Sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, and when weary men cast the big,
heavy nets, they find words to help them. I know
a lad who always gets his nets overboard with shouting
the name of the girl he loves. He has a name
for her that nobody but himself can know, or he
just shouts &#8216;Dearie,&#8217; and with one great heave, the
nets are overboard.&#8221; And as he said these words he
glanced at Christine, and her heart throbbed, and
her eyes beamed, for she knew that the lad was
Cluny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was seeing our life-boat, as I came home,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and I was feeling as if the boat could
feel, and if she hadna been sae big, I would hae
put my arms round about her. I hope that wasna
any kind o&#8217; idolatry, Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Christine. It is a feeling of our humanity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
that is wide as the world. Whatever appears
to struggle and suffer, appears to have life.
See how a boat bares her breast to the storm, and
in spite of winds and waves, wins her way home,
not losing a life that has been committed to her.
And nothing on earth can look more broken-hearted
than a stranded boat, that has lost all her men. Once
I spent a few weeks among the Hovellers&mdash;that is,
among the sailors who man the life-boats stationed
along Godwin Sands; and they used to call their
boats &#8216;darlings&#8217; and &#8216;beauties&#8217; and praise them for
behaving well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did they call the men Hovellers?&#8221; asked
Margot. &#8220;That word seems to pull down a sailor.
I don&#8217;t like it. No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been told, Margot, that it is from the
Danish word, <i>overlever</i>, which means a deliverer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kent it wasna a decent Scotch word,&#8221; she answered,
a little triumphantly; &#8220;no, nor even from
the English. Hoveller! You couldna find an uglier
word for a life-saver, and if folk canna be satisfied
wi&#8217; their ain natural tongue, and must hae a foreign
name, they might choose a bonnie one. Hoveller!
Hoveller indeed! It&#8217;s downright wicked, to ca&#8217; a
sailor a hoveller.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Domine smiled, and continued&mdash;&#8220;Every man
and woman and child has loved something inanimate.
Your mother, Christine, loves her wedding
ring, your father loves his boat, you love your
Bible, I love the silver cup that holds the sacramental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
wine we drink &#8216;in remembrance of Him&#8217;;&#8221; and he
closed his eyes a moment, and was silent. Then
he gave his cup to Christine. &#8220;No more,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;it was a good drink. Thanks be! Now our talk
must come to an end. I leave blessing with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood and watched him walk into the dusk
in silence, and then Margot said, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feyther asked him to go wi&#8217; them for this night,
and Neil didna like to refuse. Feyther has been
vera kind to him, anent his books an&#8217; the like. He
went to pleasure Feyther. It was as little as he
could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll come hame sea-sick, and his clothes
will be wet and uncomfortable as himsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, that&#8217;s his way, Mither. I wish the night
was o&#8217;er.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tak&#8217; patience. By God&#8217;s leave the day will
come.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />ANGUS BALLISTER</h2>

<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>If Love comes, it comes; but no reasoning can put it there.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Love gives a new meaning to Life.</p>

<p>Her young heart blows</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> next morning the women of the village
were early at the pier to watch the boats
come in. They were already in the offing,
their gunwales deep in the water, and rising heavily
on the ascending waves; so they knew that there
had been good fishing. Margot was prominent
among them, but Christine had gone to the town
to take orders from the fish dealers; for Margot
Ruleson&#8217;s kippered herring were famous, and eagerly
sought for, as far as Edinburgh, and even
Glasgow.</p>
<p>It was a business Christine liked, and in spite
of her youth, she did it well, having all her mother&#8217;s
bargaining ability, and a readiness in computing
values, that had been sharpened by her knowledge
of figures and profits. This morning she was unusually
fortunate in all her transactions, and brought
home such large orders that they staggered Margot.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be able to handle sae many fish,&#8221; she
said, with a happy purposeful face, &#8220;but there&#8217;s
naething beats a trial, and I be to do my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll help you, Mither. It must ne&#8217;er be said
that we twa turned good siller awa&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feared you canna do that today, Christine.
Neil hasna been to speak wi&#8217;, since he heard ye had
gone to the toun; he wouldna&#8217; even hear me when
I ca&#8217;ed breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil be to wait at this time. It willna hurt him.
If Neil happens to hae a wish, he instantly feels
it to be a necessity, and then he thinks the hale house
should stop till his wish is gi&#8217;en him. I&#8217;m going to
the herring shed wi&#8217; yoursel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there will be trouble, and no one so sorry
for it as Christine! I&#8217;m telling you!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment Neil opened the door, and looked
at the two women. &#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said in a tone
of injury and suffering, &#8220;can I have any breakfast
this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, wha&#8217;s hindering you? Your feyther had
his, an hour syne. Your porridge is yet boiling in
the pot, the kettle is simmering on the hob, and the
cheena still standing on the table. Why didna you
lift your ain porridge, and mak&#8217; yoursel&#8217; a cup o&#8217;
tea? Christine and mysel&#8217; had our breakfasts before
it chappit six o&#8217;clock. You cam&#8217; hame wi&#8217; your
feyther, you should hae ta&#8217;en your breakfast with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wet through, and covered with herring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
scales. I was in no condition to take a meal, or to sit
with my books and Christine all morning, writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna spare Christine this morning, Neil.
That&#8217;s a fact.&#8221; His provoking neatness and deliberation
were irritating to Margot&#8217;s sense of work
and hurry, and she added, &#8220;Get your breakfast as
quick as you can. I&#8217;m wanting the dishes out o&#8217;
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I can get a mouthful for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a&#8217; you want,&#8221; answered Margot; but Christine
served him with his plate of porridge and basin
of new milk, and as he ate it, she toasted a scone,
and made him a cup of tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is cross this morning, Christine. It is
annoying to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It needna. There&#8217;s a big take o&#8217; fish in, and
every man and woman, and every lad and lass, are
in the herring sheds. Mither just run awa&#8217; from
them, to see what orders for kippers I had brought&mdash;and
I hae brought nine hundred mair than usual.
I must rin awa&#8217; and help her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Christine! I want you most particularly,
this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be wi&#8217; you by three in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay with me now. I&#8217;ll be ready for you in
half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hae fifty fish ready for Mither in half an
hour, and I be to go to her at once. I&#8217;ll be back,
laddie, by three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just distracted with the delay,&#8221; but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
stopped speaking, for he saw that he was alone.
So he took time thoroughly to enjoy his scone and
tea, and then, not being quite insensible to Christine&#8217;s
kindness, he washed the dishes and put them away.</p>
<p>He had just finished this little duty, when there
was a knock at the outside door. He hesitated
about opening it. He knew no villager would knock
at his father&#8217;s door, so it must be a stranger, and
as he was not looking as professional and proper
as he always desired to appear, he was going softly
away, when the door was opened, and a bare-footed
lad came forward, and gave him a letter.</p>
<p>He opened it, and looked at the signature&mdash;&#8220;Angus
Ballister.&#8221; A sudden flush of pleasure made
him appear almost handsome, and when he had
read the epistle he was still more delighted, for it ran
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Neil,</span></p>
<p>I am going to spend the rest of vacation at Ballister Mansion,
and I want you with me. I require your help in a
particular business investigation. I will pay you for your
time and knowledge, and your company will be a great
pleasure to me. This afternoon I will call and see you,
and if you are busy with the nets, I shall enjoy helping you.</p>
<p class='sig1'>Your friend,</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Angus Ballister.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil was really much pleased with the message,
and glad to hear of an opportunity to make money,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
for though the young man was selfish, he was not
idle; and he instantly perceived that much lucrative
business could follow this early initiation into the
Ballister affairs. He quickly finished his arrangement
of the dishes and the kitchen, and then, putting
on an old academic suit, made his room as
scholarly and characteristic as possible. And it is
amazing what an <i>air</i> books and papers give to the
most commonplace abode. Even the old inkhorn
and quill pens seemed to say to all who entered&mdash;&#8220;Tread
with respect. This is classic ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>His predominating thought during this interval
was, however, not of himself, but of Christine. She
had promised to come to him at three o&#8217;clock. How
would she come? He was anxious about her first
appearance. If he could in any way have reached
her, he would have sent his positive command to
wear her best kirk clothes, but at this great season
neither chick nor child was to be seen or heard tell
of, and he concluded finally to leave what he could
not change or direct to those household influences
which usually manage things fairly well.</p>
<p>As the day went on, and Ballister did not arrive,
he grew irritably nervous. He could not study, and
he found himself scolding both Ballister and Christine
for their delay. &#8220;Christine was so ta&#8217;en up wi&#8217;
the feesh, naething else was of any import to her.
Here was a Scottish gentleman coming, who might
be the makin&#8217; o&#8217; him, and a barrel o&#8217; herrin&#8217; stood
in his <ins title='Added quote'>way.&#8221;</ins> He had actually fretted himself into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
his Scotch form of speech, a thing no Gael ever entirely
forgets when really worried to the proper
point.</p>
<p>When he had said his heart&#8217;s say of Christine,
he turned his impatience on Ballister&mdash;his behavior
was that o&#8217; the ordinary rich young man, who has
naething but himsel&#8217; to think o&#8217;. He, Neil Ruleson,
had lost a hale morning&#8217;s wark, waiting on his
lairdship. Weel, he&#8217;d have to pay for it, in the
long run. Neil Ruleson had no waste hours in his
life. Nae doubt Ballister had heard o&#8217; a fast horse,
or a fast&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Then Ballister knocked at the door, and Neil
stepped into his scholarly manner and speech, and
answered Ballister&#8217;s hearty greeting in the best English
style.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, Neil. I only came to
Ballister two days ago, and I have been thinking
of you all the time.&#8221; With these words the youth
threw his Glengary on the table, into the very center
and front of Neil&#8217;s important papers. Then he
lifted his chair, and placed it before the open door,
saying emphatically as he did so&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Lands may be fair ayont the sea,</p>
<p>But Scotland&#8217;s hills and lochs for me!</p>
</div></div>
<p>O Neil! Love of your ain country is a wonderful
thing. It makes a man of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without it you would not be a man.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>Ballister did not answer at once, but stood a
moment with his hand on the back of the deal, rush-bottomed
chair, and his gaze fixed on the sea and
the crowd of fishing boats waiting in the harbor.</p>
<p>Without being strictly handsome, Ballister was
very attractive. He had the tall, Gaelic stature, and
its reddish brown hair, also brown eyes, boyish and
yet earnest. His face was bright and well formed,
his conversation animated, his personality, in full
effect, striking in its young alertness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Neil,&#8221; he said, as he sat down. &#8220;I
came to my majority last March, when my uncle and
I were in Venice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle on your mother&#8217;s side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, on the sword side, Uncle Ballister. He
told me I was now my own master, and that he
would render into my hands the Brewster and Ballister
estates. I am sure that he has done well by
them, but he made me promise I would carefully
go over all the papers relating to his trusteeship,
and especially those concerning the item of interests.
It seems that my father had a good deal of money
out on interest&mdash;I know nothing about interest. Do
you, Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know everything that is to be known. In
my profession it is a question of importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. Now, I want to put all these papers,
rents, leases, improvements, interest accounts, and
so forth, in your hands, Neil. Come with me to
Ballister, and give the mornings to my affairs. Find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
out what is the usual claim for such service, and I
will gladly pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the amount professionally charged,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will pay the professional amount. If we give
the mornings to this work, in the afternoons we will
ride, and sail, fish or swim, or pay visits&mdash;in the
evenings there will be dinner, billiards, and conversation.
Are you willing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted at the prospect. Let the arrangement
stand, just so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be ready tomorrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The day after tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. I will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was a tap at the door, and before Neil
could answer it, Christine did so. As she entered,
Ballister stood up and looked at her, and his eyes
grew round with delighted amazement. She was
in full fisher costume&mdash;fluted cap on the back of her
curly head, scarlet kerchief on her neck, long gold
rings in her ears, gold beads round her throat, and
a petticoat in broad blue and yellow stripes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine,&#8221; said Neil, who, suddenly relieved of
his great anxiety, was unusually good-tempered.
&#8220;Christine, this is my friend, Mr. Angus Ballister.
You must have heard me speak of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact. The man was your constant
talk&#8221;&mdash;then turning to Ballister&mdash;&#8220;I am weel pleased
to see you, Sir;&#8221; and she made him a little curtsey
so full of independence that Ballister knew well she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
was making it to herself&mdash;&#8220;and I&#8217;m wondering at
you twa lads,&#8221; she said, &#8220;sitting here in the house,
when you might be sitting i&#8217; the garden, or on the
rocks, and hae the scent o&#8217; the sea, or the flowers
about ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ruleson is right,&#8221; said Ballister, in his
most enthusiastic mood. &#8220;Let us go into the garden.
Have you really a garden among these rocks? How
wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>How it came that Ballister and Christine took
the lead, and that Neil was in a manner left out,
Neil could not tell; but it struck him as very remarkable.
He saw Christine and his friend walking
together, and he was walking behind them.
Christine, also, was perfectly unembarrassed, and
apparently as much at home with Ballister as if he
had been some fisher-lad from the village.</p>
<p>Yet there was nothing strange in her easy manner
and affable intimacy. It was absolutely natural.
She had never realized the conditions of riches and
poverty, as entailing a difference in courtesy or good
comradeship; for in the village of Culraine, there
was no question of an equality founded on money.
A man or woman was rated by moral, and perhaps
a little by physical qualities&mdash;piety, honesty, courage,
industry, and strength, and knowledge of the
sea and of the fisherman&#8217;s craft. Christine would
have treated the great Duke of Fife, or Her Majesty,
Victoria, with exactly the same pleasant familiarity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>She showed Ballister her mother&#8217;s flower garden,
that was something beyond the usual, and she
was delighted at Ballister&#8217;s honest admiration and
praise of the lovely, rose-sweet plot. Both seemed
to have forgotten Neil&#8217;s presence, and Neil was
silent, blundering about in his mind, looking for
some subject which would give him predominance.</p>
<p>Happily strolling in and out the narrow walks,
and eating ripe gooseberries from the bushes, they
came to a little half-circle of laburnum trees, drooping
with the profusion of their golden blossoms.
There was a wooden bench under them, and
as Christine sat down a few petals fell into her
lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;the trees are glad o&#8217; our company,&#8221;
and she laid the petals in her palm, and
added&mdash;&#8220;now we hae shaken hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense you are talking, Christine,&#8221; said
Neil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel then, Professor, gie us a bit o&#8217; gude sense.
Folks must talk in some fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Neil could think of nothing but a skit
against women, and in apologetic mood and manner
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is allowable, to talk foolishness, in
reply to women&#8217;s foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Neil, that is cheap! Women hae as much
gude sense as men hae, and whiles they better them&#8221;&mdash;and
then she sang, freely and clearly as a bird,
two lines of Robert Burns&#8217; opinion&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;He tried His prentice hand on man,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And then He made the lasses O!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>She still held the golden blossoms in her hand, and
Ballister said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them to me. Do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are vera welcome to them, Sir. I dinna
wonder you fancy them. Laburnum trees are money-bringers,
but they arena lucky for lovers. If I hed
a sweetheart, I wouldna sit under a laburnum tree
wi&#8217; him, but Feyther is sure o&#8217; his sweetheart, and
he likes to come here, and smoke his pipe. And
Mither and I like the place for our bit secret cracks.
We dinna heed if the trees do hear us. They may
tell the birds, and the birds may tell ither birds,
but what o&#8217; that? There&#8217;s few mortals wise enough
to understand birds. Now, Neil, come awa wi&#8217; your
gude sense, I&#8217;ll trouble you nae langer wi&#8217; my foolishness.
And good day to you, Sir!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
real glad you are my brother&#8217;s friend. I dinna think
he will go out o&#8217; the way far, if you are wi&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ballister entreated her to remain, but with a smile
she vanished among the thick shrubbery. Ballister
was disappointed, and somehow Neil was not equal
to the occasion. It was hard to find a subject Ballister
felt any interest in, and after a short interval
he bade Neil good-bye and said he would see him on
the following day.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, on the day after tomorrow,&#8221; corrected Neil.
&#8220;That was the time fixed, Angus. Tomorrow I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
finish up my work for the university, and I will be
at your service, very happily and gratefully, on Friday
morning.&#8221; Then Neil led him down the garden
path to the sandy shore, so he did not return to
the cottage, but went away hungry for another sight
of Christine.</p>
<p>Neil was pleased, and displeased. He felt that
it would have been better for him if Christine had
not interfered, but there was the delayed writing
to be finished, and he hurried up the steep pathway
to the cottage. Some straying vines caught his careless
footsteps, and threw him down, and though
he was not hurt, the circumstance annoyed him. As
soon as he entered the cottage, he was met by Christine,
and her first remark added to his discomfort:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whate&#8217;er hae you been doing to yoursel&#8217;, Neil
Ruleson? Your coat is torn, and your face scratched.
Surely you werna fighting wi&#8217; your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know better, Christine. I was thrown by
those nasty blackberry vines. I intend to cut them
all down. They catch everyone that passes them,
and they are in everyone&#8217;s way. They ought to be
cleared out, and I will attend to them tomorrow
morning, if I have to get up at four o&#8217;clock to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You willna touch the vines. Feyther likes their
fruit, and Mither is planning to preserve part o&#8217; it.
And I, mysel&#8217;, am vera fond o&#8217; vines. The wee
wrens, and the robin redbreasts, look to the vines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
for food and shelter, and you&#8217;ll not dare to hurt
their feelings, for</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The Robin, wi&#8217; the red breast,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The Robin, and the wren,</p>
<p>If you do them any wrong,</p>
<p class='indent2'>You&#8217;ll never thrive again.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Stop, Christine, I have a great deal to think of,
and to ask your help in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Neil, I was ready for you at three o&#8217;clock,
and then you werna ready for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me why you dressed yourself up so much?
Did you know Ballister was coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I! Did you think I dressed mysel&#8217; up for
Angus Ballister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering. It is very seldom you wear
your gold necklace, and other things, for just home
folk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, I wasn&#8217;t wearing them for just hame folk.
Jennie Tweedie is to be married tonight, and Mither
had promised her I should come and help them lay
the table for the supper, and the like o&#8217; that. Sae
I was dressed for Jennie Tweedie&#8217;s bridal. I wasna
thinking of either you, or your fine friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you had heard he was coming.
Your fisher dress is very suitable to you. No
doubt you look handsome in it. You likely thought
its novelty would&mdash;would&mdash;make him fall in love
with you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I thought naething o&#8217; that sort. Novelty!
Where would the novelty be? The lad is Fife. If
he was sae unnoticing as never to get acquaint wi&#8217;
a Culraine fisher-wife, he lived maist o&#8217; his boyhood
in Edinburgh. Weel, he couldna escape seeing the
Newhaven fisherwomen there, nor escape hearing
their wonderful cry o&#8217; &#8216;Caller herrin&#8217;!&#8217; And if he
had ony feeling in his heart, if he once heard that cry,
sae sweet, sae heartachy, and sae winning, he couldna
help looking for the woman who was crying it; and
then he couldna help seeing a fisher-wife, or lassie.
I warn you not to think o&#8217; me, Christine Ruleson,
planning and dressing mysel&#8217; for any man. You
could spane my love awa&#8217; wi&#8217; a very few o&#8217; such
remarks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant nothing to wrong you, Christine. All
girls dress to please the men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men think sae. They are vera mich mista&#8217;en.
Girls dress to outdress each ither. If you hae any
writing to do, I want to gie you an hour&#8217;s wark.
I&#8217;ll hae to leave the rest until morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Neil told her the whole of the proposal
Angus had made him. He pointed out its benefits,
both for the present and the future, and Christine
listened thoughtfully to all he said. She saw even
further than Neil did, the benefits, and she was
the first to name the subject nearest to Neil&#8217;s anxieties.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Neil,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you go to Ballister,
you be to hae the proper dress for every occasion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
The best suit ye hae now will be nane too good for
you to wark, and to play in. You must hae a new
suit for ordinary wear, forbye a full dress suit. I&#8217;ll
tell you what to do&mdash;David Finlay, wha dresses a&#8217;
the men gentry round about here, is an old, old
friend o&#8217; Feyther&#8217;s. They herded together, and went
to school and kirk togither, and Feyther and him
have helped each ither across hard places, a&#8217; their
life long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any favors from David Finlay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hae a little patience, lad. I&#8217;m not asking you
to tak&#8217; favors from anyone. I, mysel&#8217;, will find the
money for you; but I canna tell you how men ought
to dress, nor what they require in thae little odds
and ends, which are so important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Odds and ends! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neckties, gloves, handkerchiefs, hats, and a
proper pocket book for your money. I saw Ballister
take his from his pocket, to put the laburnum
leaves in, and I had a glint o&#8217; the bank bills in it,
and I ken weel it is more genteel-like than a purse.
I call things like these &#8216;odds and ends.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such things cost a deal of money, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming to that, Neil. I hae nearly ninety-six
pounds in the bank. It hes been gathering there,
ever since my grandfeyther put five pounds in for me
at my baptisement&mdash;as a nest egg, ye ken&mdash;and all I
hae earned, and all that Feyther or Mither hae gien
me, has helped it gather; and on my last birthday,
when Feyther gave me a pound, and Mither ten shillings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
I had ninety-six pounds. Now, Neil, dear lad,
you can hae the use o&#8217; it all, if so be you need it.
Just let Dave Finlay tell you what to get, and get it,
and pay him for it&mdash;you can pay me back, when
money comes easy to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Christine! You have always been
my good angel. I will pay you out o&#8217; my first earnings.
I&#8217;ll give you good interest, and a regular
I. O. U. which will be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you saying, Neil? Interest! Interest!
Interest on love? And do you dare to talk to me
anent your I. O. U. If I canna trust your love,
and your honor, I&#8217;ll hae neither interest nor paper
from you. Tak my offer wi&#8217; just the word between
us, you are vera welcome to the use o&#8217; the money.
There&#8217;s nae sign o&#8217; my marrying yet, and I&#8217;ll not
be likely to want it until my plenishing and napery
is to buy. You&#8217;ll go to Finlay, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly will. He shall give me just what
is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, my time is up. I will be ready to
do your copying at five o&#8217;clock in the morning.
Then, after breakfast, you can go to the town, but
you won&#8217;t win into the Bank before ten, and maist
likely Finlay will be just as late. Leave out the
best linen you hae, and I&#8217;ll attend to it, wi&#8217; my ain
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christine, how sweet and good you are! I&#8217;m
afraid I am not worthy o&#8217; your love!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vera likely you are not. Few brothers love their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
sisters as they ought to. It willna be lang before
you&#8217;ll do like the lave o&#8217; them, and put some strange
lass before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nae lass living that can ever be to me
what you hae been, and are. You hae been mother
and sister baith, to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear lad, I love thee with a&#8217; my heart. All
that is mine, is thine, for thy use and help, and between
thee and me the word and the bond are the
same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christine was much pleased because Neil unconsciously
had fallen into his Scotch dialect. She knew
then that his words were spontaneous, not of consideration,
but of feeling from his very heart.</p>
<p>In a week the change contemplated had been fully
accomplished. Neil had become accustomed to the
luxury of his new home, and was making notable
progress in the work which had brought him
there.</p>
<p>Twice during the week Margot had been made
royally happy by large baskets of wonderful flowers
and fruit, from the Ballister gardens. They were
brought by the Ballister gardener, and came with
Neil&#8217;s love and name, but Margot had some secret
thoughts of her own. She suspected they were the
result of a deeper and sweeter reason than a mere
admiration for her wonderful little garden among
the rocks; but she kept such thoughts silent in her
heart. One thing she knew well, that if Christine
were twitted on the subject, she would hate Angus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
Ballister, and utterly refuse to see him. So she
referred to the gifts as entirely from Neil, and affected
a little anxiety about their influence on Ballister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that young man isna thinking,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;that his baskets o&#8217; flowers and fruit is pay enough
for Neil&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither, he promised to pay Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure. But I didna hear o&#8217; any fixed sum.
Some rich people hae a way o&#8217; giving sma&#8217; favors,
and forgetting standing siller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He seemed a nice young man, Mither, and he did
admire your garden. I am sure he has told Neil
to send the flowers because you loved flowers. When
folk love anything, they like others who love as they
do. Mebbe they who love flowers hae the same
kind and order o&#8217; souls. You ken if a man loves
dogs, he is friendly at once wi&#8217; a stranger who loves
dogs; and there&#8217;s the Domine, who is just silly
anent auld coins&mdash;copper, siller or gold&mdash;he cares
not, if they&#8217;re only auld enough. Nannie Grant,
wha keeps his house, told Katie Tweedie that he
took a beggar man into his parlor, and ate his dinner
with him, just because he had a siller bit o&#8217;
Julius C&#230;sar in his pouch, and wouldna part wi&#8217; it,
even when he was wanting bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel then, the Domine doubtless wanted the
penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vera likely, but he wouldna tak it frae the puir
soul, wha thought sae much o&#8217; it; and Nannie was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
saying that he went away wi&#8217; a guid many Victoria
pennies i&#8217; his pouch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine is a queer man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but a vera guid man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he had a wife, he would be a&#8217; right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And just as likely a&#8217; wrang. Wha can tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, that&#8217;s an open question. What about
your ain marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll marry when I find a man who loves the
things I love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, the change for Neil, and for the a&#8217; of us
has been&mdash;in a way&mdash;a gude thing. I&#8217;ll say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot was right. Even if we take change in its
widest sense, it is a great and healthy manifestation,
and it is only through changes that the best lives
are made perfect. For every phase of life requires
its own environment, in order to fulfill perfectly its
intention and if it does not get it, then the intent,
or the issue, loses much of its efficiency. &#8220;Because
they have no changes, therefore they fear not God,&#8221;
is a truth relative to the greatest nations, as well as
to the humblest individual.</p>
<p>Neil was benefited in every way by the social uplift
of a residence in a gentleman&#8217;s home, and the
active, curious temperament of Angus stimulated
him. Angus was interested in every new thing, in
every new idea, in every new book. The world was
so large, and so busy, and he wanted to know all
about its goings on. So when Neil&#8217;s business was
over for the day, Angus was eagerly waiting to tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
him of something new or strange which he had just
read, or heard tell of, and though Neil did not realize
the fact, he was actually receiving, in these lively
discussions with his friend, the very best training
for his future forensic and oratorical efforts.</p>
<p>Indeed he was greatly pleased with himself. He
had not dreamed of being the possessor of so much
skill in managing an opposite opinion; nor yet of
the ready wit, which appeared to flow naturally with
his national dialect. But all this clever discussion
and disputing was excellent practice, and Neil knew
well that his visit to Ballister had been a change
full of benefits to him.</p>
<p>One of the results of Neil&#8217;s investigations was the
discovery that Dr. Magnus Trenabie had been presented
to the church of Culraine by the father of
Angus, and that his salary had never been more
than fifty pounds a year, with the likelihood that
it had often been much less. Angus was angry and
annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give my gamekeeper a larger salary,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It is a shame! The doctor&#8217;s salary must be
doubled at once. If there are any technicalities
about it, look to them as quickly as possible. Did
my father worship in that old church?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did, and I have heard my father tell very
frequently, how the old man stood by the church
when the great Free Kirk secession happened. He
says that at that burning time everyone left Dr.
Trenabie&#8217;s church but Ballister and ten o&#8217; his tenants,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and that the doctor took no notice of their desertion,
but just preached to your father and the ten
faithful. He was never heard to blame the lost
flock, and he never went into the wilderness after
them. Your father would not hear of his doing
so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Magnus,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;tak&#8217; time, and bide a
wee. The puir wanderers will get hungry and
weary in their Free Kirk conventicles, and as the
night comes on, they&#8217;ll come hame. Nae fear o&#8217;
them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they come home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one of them but three stubborn old men.
They died out of its communion, and the old Master
pitied them, and told their friends he was feared
that it would go a bit hard wi&#8217; them. He said,
they had leaped the fence, and he shook his head,
and looked down and doubtful anent the outcome,
since naebody could tell what ill weeds were in a
strange pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this discovery Angus went to the old church,
where his father had worshiped, and there he saw
Christine, and there he fell freshly in love with
her every Sabbath day. It did not appear likely
that love had much opportunity, in those few minutes
in the kirk yard after the service, when Neil
and Angus waited for Margot and Christine, to exchange
the ordinary greetings and inquiries. James
Ruleson, being leading elder, always remained a few
minutes after the congregation had left, in order
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
to count the collection and give it to the Domine,
and in those few minutes Love found his opportunity.</p>
<p>While Neil talked with his mother of their family
affairs, Angus talked with Christine. His eyes
rained Love&#8217;s influence, his voice was like a caress,
the touch of his hand seemed to Christine to draw
her in some invisible way closer to him. She never
remembered the words he said, she only knew their
inarticulate meaning was love, always love. When
it was time for Ruleson to appear, Margot turned
to Angus and thanked him for some special gift or
kindness that had come to the cottage that week,
and Angus always laughed, and pointing to Neil,
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil is the culprit, Mrs. Ruleson. It is Neil&#8217;s
doing, I assure you.&#8221; And of course this statement
might be, in several ways, the truth. At any
rate, the old proverb which advises us &#8220;never to
look a gift horse in the mouth,&#8221; is a good one. For
the motive of the gift is more than the gift itself.</p>
<p>These gifts were all simple enough, but they
were such as delighted Margot&#8217;s childlike heart&mdash;an
armful of dahlias or carnations&mdash;a basket of
nectarines or apricots&mdash;two or three dozen fresh
eggs&mdash;a pot of butter&mdash;a pair of guinea fowls, then
rare in poultry yards, or a brood of young turkeys
to feed and fatten for the New Year&#8217;s festival.
About these fowls, Neil wrote her elaborate directions.
And Margot was more delighted with these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
simple gifts than many have been with a great estate.
And Christine knew, and Angus knew that
she knew, and it was a subtle tie between them, made
of meeting glances and clasping hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />THE FISHERMAN&#8217;S FAIR</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 22em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>The winds go up and down upon the sea,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And some they lightly clasp, entreating kindly,</p>
<p>And waft them to the port where they would be:</p>
<p class='indent2'>And other ships they buffet long and blindly.</p>
<p>The cloud comes down on the great sinking deep,</p>
<p>And on the shore, the watchers stand and weep.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>So</span> the busy fishing season passed away, and was
a very fortunate one, until it was nearly over.
Then there were several days of foggy, dismal
weather, and one night when the nets were down a
sudden violent storm drove from the north, and the
boats, being at that time mostly open boats, shipped
water at every sea. The greatest hurry and confusion
followed, and they were finally compelled to
cut the nets adrift, glad indeed to lose all, if they
could only make the first shelter. And mothers and
wives, standing helpless at the little windows of their
cottages, watched the storm, while the men they
loved were fighting the furious tempest in the black
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;God help my men!&#8221; prayed Margot. She was
weeping like a child, but yet in her anguish full of
faith in God&#8217;s mercy, and looking trustfully to Him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
to send her men home again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er fret for
the nets,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they&#8217;ll hav&#8217; to go, nae doubt
o&#8217; that. Let them go! But oh, Feyther i&#8217; heaven,
send hame my men folk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah! Women who spend such nights may well
call caller herrin&#8217; &#8220;the lives o&#8217; men&#8221;!</p>
<p>In the misty daylight, the men and the boats came
into harbor, but the nets in every boat&mdash;each net
about eight hundred and fifty yards long&mdash;were
totally lost. However, the herring season was practically
over. Indeed, the men were at the point of
exhaustion, for the total take had been very large,
and there is scarcely any human labor more severe
on the physical endurance, than the fishing for caller
herrin&#8217;.</p>
<p>It was just at this time that Neil Ruleson had to
leave Culraine for Aberdeen. He was to finish his
course at the Maraschal College this year, and never
before had he gone there so well provided, and
never before had he felt so poor. For though he
had received the unlooked-for sum of two hundred
pounds for his services, he felt it to be unequal to
his ambitious requirements, six weeks at Ballister
House having taught him to regard many little comforts
as absolute necessities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very nearly a lawyer now,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;a
professional man, and I must try and look like it,
and live like it. The bare room and unfashionable
clothing of the past must be changed to more respectable
quarters, and more appropriate garments.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Of course he knew that Christine would not permit
him to injure his future fine prospects, but he had
promised to repay the ninety pounds he had borrowed
from her out of his first earnings, and he felt
that the money was now due, and that he ought to
pay it. But if he did so, he must simplify all his
plans, and he had taken so much pleasure and pains
in arranging the surroundings of his last session,
that he was exceedingly loth to surrender even the
least important of them.</p>
<p>While he was packing his trunk, and deliberating
on this subject, the great storm came, and his father
barely saved the boat and the lives of the men in
her. The nets were gone, and his mother asked
him plainly if he could not help his father to replace
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do so gladly, Mother,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;when I have paid my college fees, and the like, I
will see what I can spare&mdash;there is Christine&#8217;s
money!&#8221; he continued, in a troubled, thoughtful
manner&mdash;and Margot answered,</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, to be sure. If Christine hadna loaned you
her money, it would hae been at her feyther&#8217;s will
and want, this moment, but if you are going to keep
your word, and pay Christine out o&#8217; your first earnings,
there&#8217;s nae need to talk wi&#8217; you. Christine
will help your feyther and proud and glad to do the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Mother, it is nearly the end of things
with me at Aberdeen, and it would be hard if my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
future was scrimped at its beginning. That is what
Ballister thinks. &#8216;Neil,&#8217; he said to me, &#8216;you will have
to speak before the public&mdash;lawyers and people of
full standing&mdash;and you must have the dress that is
proper and fitting.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, your feyther will hae to get new nets&mdash;if
he is to mak&#8217; bread for the lave o&#8217; us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The herring season is over now, and there is no
immediate expense regarding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are much mista&#8217;en, and ye ken it fine! The
barrels in which the fish are packed are to pay for,
and the women who packed them are not fully paid.
The coopers who closed the barrels, and the Fishery
Office, hae yet to send in their bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fishery Office! What have we to do with
the Fishery Office? It is a government affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe sae. But the barrels canna be shipped
until an officer frae the Fishery Office puts the crown
brand on every barrel. Do you think the man does
that for naething?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of such a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, it has to be done, whether Neil Ruleson
has heard o&#8217; the thing or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The crown isna branded on any barrel unless
the fish in it are fine, fresh, and unbroken. But as
soon as the barrels get the crown, they can be shipped
to foreign ports, mostly to Stettin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Stettin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Ask your feyther. You are just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
making a put-aff wi&#8217; your questions. Answer me
the one question I asked yoursel&#8217;&mdash;What can ye do
to help your feyther? Answer me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father will not use nets until the next herring
season&mdash;a whole year away&mdash;in the winter, he always
does line fishing. With your help, Christine
can weave new nets before they are needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see weel that you dinna intend to pay
your debt to Christine, nor yet to help your
feyther.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father has not asked me for help. Everyone
knows that father is well fore-handed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O lad, the dear auld man barely saved the boat
and the lives she carried! He has been roughly handled
by winds and waves, and may hae to keep his
bed awhile, and your brither Eneas is that hurt
and bruised, he will ne&#8217;er go fishing again, while
your brither Norman has a broken arm, an&#8217; a wife
that has gane into hystericals about the lost nets.
You&#8217;d think it was her man she was screaming for.
And Fae and Tamsen waited too lang, and went
o&#8217;er the boat wi&#8217; their nets, an&#8217; there&#8217;s ithers that
hae broken limbs, or joints out o&#8217; place, or trouble
o&#8217; some sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, Mother. If I could do any good
to the general ill, I would do it, but if I ruined all
my future life I do not see that I could help anyone.
I must be just, before I am generous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure. I hope you&#8217;ll try to be just, for I
am vera certain you&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be generous; and if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
are just, you&#8217;ll pay your sister back her ninety
pounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will have a conversation with Christine, at
once. Where is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine sent for her early, she has been
helping him wi&#8217; the hurt folk, all day long. What
hae you been doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went down to the pier, to look after the boat.
I knew father would be anxious about it. Then I
had to go into the town. I was expecting an important
letter, and the doctor was needing some
medicines, and I brought them home with me. In
one way, or another, the miserable day has gone.
I hope Father is not much hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to hurt your feyther. His head keeps
steady, and a steady head keeps the body as it should
be&mdash;but he&#8217;s strained, and kind o&#8217; shocked. The
Domine gied him a powder, and he&#8217;s sleeping like a
baby. He&#8217;ll be a&#8217; right in a day or twa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to sit by him tonight, and do all I
can, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may well do that, Neil; but first go and
bring your sister hame. I wouldn&#8217;t wonder if you
might find her in Fae&#8217;s cottage. His puir, silly wife
let the baby fa&#8217;, when she heard that her man and
his boat was lost; and I heard tell Christine had
ta&#8217;en the bairn in charge. It would be just like her.
Weel, it&#8217;s growing to candle lighting, and I&#8217;ll put
a crusie fu&#8217; o&#8217; oil in feyther&#8217;s room, and that will
light you through the night.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>Neil found his sister sitting with Judith Macpherson
and her grandson, Cluny. Cluny was not seriously
hurt, but no man comes out of a life-and-death
fight with the sea, and feels physically the better for
it. Such tragic encounters do finally lift the soul
into the region of Fearlessness, or into the still
higher condition of Trustfulness, but such an education&mdash;like
that of Godliness&mdash;requires line upon line,
precept upon precept.</p>
<p>James Ruleson had been perfectly calm, even
when for a few minutes it seemed as if men, as well
as nets, must go to death and destruction; but James
had been meeting the God &#8220;whose path is on the
Great Waters,&#8221; for more than forty years, and had
seen there, not only His wonders, but His mercies,
and he had learned to say with David, &#8220;Though He
slay me, yet will I put my trust in Him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith Macpherson was of a different spirit. She
was a passionate old woman, and the sea had taken
her husband and five sons, and her only daughter.
Accordingly she hated the sea. That some day it
would be &#8220;no more&#8221; was her triumphant consolation.
She delighted in preaching to it this sentence
of annihilation. If Judith was seen standing on the
cliffs, with her arms uplifted, and her white head
thrown backward, the village knew she was reminding
its proud waves of their doom of utter destruction.
The passionate flaming language of her denunciations
will not bear transcribing, but the oldest
sailors said it was &#8220;awesome and no&#8217; to be listened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to, or spoken o&#8217;.&#8221; That afternoon she had been
seen on the sands, in one of her frenzies of hatred,
and when Neil entered her cottage, she was still
rocking herself to and fro, and muttering threats
and curses.</p>
<p>She had attended skillfully and tenderly to Cluny&#8217;s
bruises and nervous excitement, but he was frightened
and depressed by her mood, and he begged
Christine to stay wi&#8217; him an hour or twa. And
Christine had been willing. Judith was always kind
to her, and the handsome lad with his boyish adoration
was at least a settled feature of her life. This
night she let him tell her all his plans for their
happy future, and did not feel any pressure of duty
to deny his hopes. He had just come out of the
very jaws of Death. What could she do, but let
him dream his dream and have his say?</p>
<p>However, in all troubles, either personal or public,
it is a great thing to be still, and to whisper to
the soul&mdash;&#8220;This, too, will pass!&#8221; It is behind us
today, tomorrow it will be still farther away. In a
week we shall not talk of it, in a month it will have
passed from Life, and belong only to Memory.
There is scarcely any sorrow that may not be greatly
helped and soothed by this reflection. For God does
not willingly afflict the children of men, and it is He
Himself, that has appointed Time to be the consoler
of Sorrow.</p>
<p>By the end of October, the village was in its
normal mood and condition. All the expenses of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
fishing season had been paid, and the profits satisfactorily
ascertained and divided. Great quantities
of cord had been procured, and the women and the
older men were busily making nets for the next season,
while the younger men were ready for the winter&#8217;s
line-fishing. There was an air of content and
even of happiness over the small community. It
was realized that, in spite of the storm, the season
had been good, and the Domine had reminded them
on the last Sabbath, that they had not yet rendered
thanks to God, nor even visibly told each other how
good God had been to them.</p>
<p>For it was the custom of Culraine to keep a day
of thanks and rejoicing when the herring had been
secured, and to send word to all the near-by fishers
to come and rejoice with them. They began now to
prepare for this festival, and in this preparation
were greatly assisted by gifts from Ballister House.
Neil had gone back to the Maraschal, but Angus
was still at Ballister. He had been royally generous
to the village in its distress, had supplied the
Domine with necessary drugs and materials, and had
seen to it that the injured had those little luxuries
of food which tempt the convalescent. He was still
more eager to help the fishers in their thanksgiving,
Margot Ruleson being the authorized distributor of
all his gifts, as she was also the director of all concerning
the affair.</p>
<p>This <i>foy</i>, or fair, was to be kept on the thirty-first
of October, embracing particularly the Hallowe&#8217;en
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
night so dear to the peasantry of Scotland.
The Domine had selected this date, possibly because
he wished to prevent its usual superstitious observance.
But though some old men and women doubtless
lighted their Hallowe&#8217;en fires, and baked
their Hallowe&#8217;en cake, with the usual magical ceremonies,
the large majority were far too busy preparing
for an actual and present pleasure, to
trouble themselves about prophesying spells and
charms.</p>
<p>The day was opened by a short address to the people
assembled in the old kirk. About thirty minutes
covered the simple ceremony. First the Domine
stood up, and the people stood up with him, and all
together they recited aloud the jubilant thirty-fourth
psalm. Then the Domine said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, friends, and take heed to what I say.
I have no sermon for you today. I have no sins to
charge you with, and to beg you to forsake. I have
just one message. It is three words long. &#8216;God is
Love!&#8217; Whatever you hear, whatever you do, no
matter what happens to you, remember that God is
Love! You are heritage-born to the sea, but the
way of the Lord is through the Great Waters. God
must see you in your struggles, and God must love
the patient, brave, sailormen. Christ showed you
special favors. He might have chosen carpenters,
but he chose fishermen. And for seeing God&#8217;s wonders
on the deep sea, you may be the sons and heirs
of the prophet Jonas. Also,</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The church is like unto a ship:</p>
<p>The Scriptures are the enclosing net</p>
<p>And men the fishers are!</p>
</div></div>
<p>Well, then, as often as you come unto a sermon,
consider how God by his preachers trawleth for
your souls. Friends, in all times of your joy and
your sorrow, you have the key to God&#8217;s council
chamber, and to God&#8217;s mercy chamber. It is just
&#8216;Our Father,&#8217; and the few blessed words that follow
it. There is little need for long talk. This is the
day you have set for thanksgiving. Rejoice therein!
God is as well pleased with your happiness, as he
was and is with your good, brave work. The hard
winter days wear on. Make this day a memory to
brighten them. Amen.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a considerable number of visitors from
fishing villages as far south as Largo, going from
house to house, talking over old seasons with old
comrades, and there were the sound of violins everywhere,
and the laughter of children, in their Sunday
clothes, playing in the streets. Even sorrowful
Faith Balcarry was in a new dress, and was at least
helping others to be happy. Indeed, it was Faith
who suddenly burst into the Hall when the decorations
were nearly finished, and cried, &#8220;Surely you&#8217;ll
show the flags o&#8217; the lads&#8217; boaties! They&#8217;ll feel
hurt if you slight their bits o&#8217; canvas! It is most
like slighting themsel&#8217;s.&#8221; She had her arms full of
these bits of canvas, and the men decorating the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Fishers&#8217; Hall seized them triumphantly, and told
Faith they were just what they wanted; and so made
Faith for once in her sad life a person helpful and
of importance. Then in twenty minutes the red and
blue and white ensigns were beautifully disposed
among the green of larch and laurel, and the glory
of marigolds and St. Michael&#8217;s daisies, and of holly
oaks of every brilliant color.</p>
<p>When the sun was setting Angus looked in.
Everyone but Christine and Faith had finished his
work and gone away. Faith was brushing up the
scattered leaves from the floor, Christine was standing
on the top step of the ladder, setting her father&#8217;s
flag in a halo of marigolds. He watched her without
speaking until she turned, then the swift glory
of her smile, and the joy of her surprise was a revelation.
He had not dreamed before that she was
so beautiful. He said he was hungry, and he hoped
Christine would not send him all the way to Ballister
for something to eat. Then what could Christine
do but ask him to dinner? And she had already
asked Faith. So he walked between Christine and
Faith up to Ruleson&#8217;s cottage. And the walk
through the village was so exhilarating, he must
have forgotten he was hungry, even if he was really
so. There was music everywhere, there were groups
of beautiful women, already dressed in their gayest
gowns and finest ornaments, there were equal groups
of handsome young fishermen, in their finest tweed
suits, with flowing neckties of every resplendent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
color&mdash;there was such a sense of pleasure and content
in the air, that everyone felt as if he were
breathing happiness.</p>
<p>And Margot&#8217;s welcome was in itself a tonic, if
anybody had needed one. Her table was already
set, she was &#8220;only waiting for folks to find out they
wanted their dinner&mdash;the dinner itsel&#8217; was waitin&#8217;
and nane the better o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruleson came in as she was speaking, and he welcomed
the Master of Ballister with true Scotch hospitality.
They fell into an easy conversation on politics,
and Margot told Christine and Faith to mak&#8217;
themsel&#8217;s fit for company, and to be quick anent the
business, or she wadna keep three folk waiting on a
couple o&#8217; lasses.</p>
<p>In half an hour both girls came down, dressed in
white. Christine had loaned Faith a white frock,
and a string of blue beads, and a broad blue sash.
She had arranged her hair prettily, and made the girl
feel that her appearance was of consequence. And
light came into Faith&#8217;s eyes, and color to her cheeks,
and for once she was happy, whether she knew it
or not.</p>
<p>Christine had intended to wear a new pink silk
frock, with all its pretty accessories, but a beautiful
natural politeness forbade it. Faith was so abnormally
sensitive, she knew she would spoil the
girl&#8217;s evening if she outdressed her. So she also
put on a white muslin gown, made in the modest
fashion of the early Victorian era. Some lace and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
white satin ribbons softened it, and she had in her
ears her long gold rings, and round her throat her
gold beads, and amidst her beautiful hair large amber
combs, that looked as if they had imprisoned the
sunshine.</p>
<p>Margot was a good cook, and the dinner was an
excellent one, prolonged&mdash;as Margot thought&mdash;beyond
all reasonable length, by a discussion, between
Ruleson and Angus, of the conservative policy.
Ruleson smoked his pipe after dinner, and kept up
the threep, and the girls put out of sight the used
china, and the meat and pastries left, and Margot
put on her usual Sabbath attire&mdash;a light-gray silk
dress, a large white collar, and a borderless cap
of lace over her dark hair. The indispensable bit
of color was, in her case, supplied by a vivid scarlet
shawl of Chinese crêpe, one of those heavily embroidered
shawls of dazzling color, which seem in
these latter days to have disappeared.</p>
<p>It was getting near to seven o&#8217;clock, when they
entered the hall and found it already full and happy.
They had not thought it necessary to wait in whispering
silence, until the music came and opened the
entertainment. They possessed among themselves
many good story tellers, and they were heartily
laughing in chorus at some comic incident which a
fisherman was relating, when the Ruleson party arrived.</p>
<p>Then there was one long, loud, unanimous cry for
Christine Ruleson, for Christine was preëminent as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
a vive-voce story teller, a rare art even among the
nations of Europe. She nodded and smiled, and
without any affectation of reluctance, but with a
sweet readiness to give pleasure, went at once to the
platform, and as easily, and as naturally as if she
were telling it at her home fireside, she raised her
hand for attention, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;<i>The Wreck of the Grosvenor</i></h3>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Grosvenor</i>, an East Indiaman, homeward
bound, went to pieces on the coast of Caffraria.
There were a hundred and thirty-five souls on board,
and they resolved to cross the trackless desert to
the Dutch settlements at the Cape of Good Hope.
A solitary child was among the passengers, a boy
of seven years old, who had no relation on board,
and when he saw the party beginning to move away,
he cried after some member of it, who had been kind
to him. The child&#8217;s cry went to every heart. They
accepted him as a sacred charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;By turns they carried him through the deep sand
and the long grass. They pushed him across broad
rivers on a little raft. They shared with him such
fish as they found to eat. Beset by lions, by savages,
by hunger and death in ghastly forms, they never&mdash;O
Father in heaven! Thy name be blessed for it!
they never forgot the child. The captain and his
faithful coxswain sat down together to die, the rest
go on for their lives&mdash;but they take the child with
them. The carpenter, his chief friend, dies from eating,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
in his hunger, poisonous berries; the steward assumed
the sacred guardianship of the boy. He carried
him in his arms, when he himself was weak
and suffering. He fed him, when he was griped
with hunger. He laid his little white face against
his sun-burned breast. He soothed him in all his
suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there came a time when both were ill, and
they begged their wretched companions&mdash;now very
few in number&mdash;to wait for them one day. They
waited two days. On the morning of the third day,
they moved softly about preparing to resume their
journey. The child was sleeping by the fire, and
they would not wake him until the last moment.
The moment comes, the fire is dying&mdash;the child is
dead!</p>
<p>&#8220;His faithful friend staggers on for a few days,
then lies down in the desert and dies. What shall
be said to these two men, who through all extremities
loved and guarded this Little Child?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christine had noticed the Domine rise, and she
pointedly addressed this question to him, and he understood
her wish, and lifting up his hands and his
voice, he cried out triumphantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;They shall be raised up with the words&mdash;&#8216;Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye
have done it unto Me!&#8217; These good men,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;were men of the sea, Mariners of England,</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;That guard our native seas,</p>
<p>Whose flag has braved a thousand years,</p>
<p>The battle and the breeze!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The Domine might have continued, but there was
a sudden thrill of enchanting violins, the door was
flung open, and the magical notes of a foursome reel
filled the room, and set the feet of all tapping the
floor, and made all faces radiant with anticipation.
The good man then realized that it was not his hour,
and he sat down, and watched the proceedings for
a few minutes. Then he saw James Ruleson take
his wife&#8217;s hand, and watched their first steps in the
joyous reel, and he was satisfied. If the dancing
was under Ruleson&#8217;s control, he knew all would be
done decently and in order, and he went away so
quietly that his absence was not noticed for some
time.</p>
<p>Now, if the dancing that followed was like some
of our dancing of today, I should pass it with slight
notice, or it might be, with earnest disapproval, but
it was not. It was real dancing. It was not waltzing,
nor tangoing, and it was as far as possible from
the undressed posturing called classical dancing.
Everyone was modestly clothed, and had his shoes
and stockings on. And naturally, and as a matter
of course, they obeyed the principle of real dancing,
which is articulation; that is, the foot strikes the
ground with every accented note of the music. This
is how Goldsmith in &#8220;The Vicar of Wakefield&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
shows us Olivia dancing&mdash;&#8220;her foot being as pat to
the music, as its echo.&#8221;</p>
<p>All good dancing is beautiful, and it never requires
immodesty, is indeed spoiled by any movement
in this direction. However, as my fisher company
danced modestly and gracefully, rendering
naturally the artistic demands of the music, there is
no necessity to pursue the subject. As the night wore
on, the dancing became more enthusiastic, and graceful
gestures were flung in, and little inspiring cries
flung out, and often when the fiddles stopped, the
happy feet went on for several bars without the
aid of music.</p>
<p>Thus alternately telling stories, singing, and
dancing, they passed the happy hours, mingling
something of heart, and brain, and body, in all they
did; and the midnight found them unwearied and
good-tempered. Angus had behaved beautifully.
Having made himself &#8220;Hail! Well met!&#8221; with the
company, he forgot for the time that he was Master
of Ballister, and entered into the happy spirit of
the occasion with all the natural gayety of youth.</p>
<p>As he had dined with Faith Balcarry, he danced
with her several times; and no one could tell the
pride and pleasure in the girl&#8217;s heart. Then
Christine introduced to her a young fisherman from
Largo town, and he liked Faith&#8217;s slender form, and
childlike face, and fell truly in love with the lonely
girl, and after this night no one ever heard Faith
complain that she had no one to love, and that no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
one loved her. This incident alone made Christine
very happy, for her heart said to her that it was
well worth while.</p>
<p>Cluny was the only dissatisfied person present,
but then nothing would have satisfied Cluny but
Christine&#8217;s undivided attention. She told him he
was &#8220;unreasonable and selfish,&#8221; and he went home
with his grandmother, in a pet, and did not return.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s weel enough awa&#8217;,&#8221; said Christine to Faith.
&#8220;If he couldna leave his bad temper at hame, he
hadna ony right to bring it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it was not possible for Christine to
avoid all dancing with Angus, but he was reasonable
and obedient, and danced cheerfully with all the
partners she selected, and in return she promised to
walk home in his company. He told her it was
&#8220;a miraculous favor,&#8221; and indeed he thought so.
For never had she looked so bewilderingly lovely.
Her beauty appeared to fill the room, and the calm,
confident authority with which she ordered and decided
events, touched him with admiring astonishment.
What she would become, when <i>he</i> gave her
the opportunity, he could not imagine.</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock there was a sideboard supper from
a long table at one side of the hall, loaded with cold
meats, pastry, and cake. Every young man took
what his partner desired, and carried it to her. Then
when the women were served, the men helped themselves,
and stood eating and talking with the merry,
chattering groups for a pleasant half-hour, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
gave to the last dances and songs even more than
their early enthusiasm. Angus waited on Christine
and Faith, and Faith&#8217;s admirer had quite a flush of
vanity, in supposing himself to have cut the Master
of Ballister out. He flattered himself thus, and
Faith let him think so, and Christine shook her head,
and called him &#8220;plucky and gay,&#8221; epithets young
men never object to, especially if they know they are
neither the one nor the other.</p>
<p>At twelve o&#8217;clock Ruleson spoke to the musicians,
and the violins dropped from the merry reel of
&#8220;Clydeside Lasses&#8221; into the haunting melody of
&#8220;Caller Herrin&#8217;,&#8221; and old and young stood up to
sing it. Margot started the &#8220;cry&#8221; in her clear,
clarion-like voice; but young and old joined in the
imperishable song, in which the &#8220;cry&#8221; is vocalized:</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock the Fishers&#8217; Hall was dark and
still, and the echo of a tender little laugh or song
from some couple, who had taken the longest way
round for the nearest way home, was all that remained
of the mirth and melody of the evening.
Angus and Christine sauntered slowly through the
village. The young man was then passionately importunate
in the protestations of his love. He
wooed Christine with all the honeyed words that men
have used to the Beloved Woman, since the creation.
And Christine listened and was happy.</p>
<p>At length, however, he was obliged to tell her
news he had delayed as long as it was possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dear Christine, I am going
with my Uncle Ballister to the United States.
We intend to see both the northern and southern
states, and in California shall doubtless find the
ways and means to cross over to China and Japan,
and at Hongkong get passage for India, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then whar next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through Europe to England. I dare say the
journey will take us a whole year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mair likely twa or even three years. Whatna
for are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because my uncle is going, and he is set on having
me with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t wonder. Maybe he is going just for
your sake. Weel I hope you&#8217;ll hae a brawly fine
time, and come hame the better for it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell how I am to do without seeing
you, for a whole year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Folk get used to doing without, vera easy, if the
want isn&#8217;t siller. Love isna a necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, but it is! Dear Christine, it is the great
necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, I&#8217;m not believing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they were at the foot of the hill on which
Ruleson&#8217;s house stood, and Christine said, &#8220;Your
carriage is waiting for you, Angus, and you be to
bid me good night, here. I would rather rin up
the hill by mysel&#8217;, and nae doubt the puir horses
are weary standin&#8217; sae lang. Sae good night, and
good-by, laddie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not leave you, Christine, until I have seen
you safely home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at hame here. This is Ruleson&#8217;s hill, and
feyther and mither are waiting up for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few imperative words from Angus put a stop
to the dispute, and he climbed the hill with her. He
went as slowly as possible, and told her at every step
how beautiful she was, and how entirely he loved
her. But Christine was not responsive, and in spite
of his eloquent tenderness, they felt the chill of their
first disagreement. When they came in sight of the
house, they saw that it was dimly lit, and Christine
stood still, and once more bade him good-by.</p>
<p>Angus clasped both her hands in his. &#8220;My love!
My love!&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I spoke cross, forgive
me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hae naething to forgive. I owe you for mair
pleasure and happiness, than I can ever return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me one kiss of love and forgiveness,
Christine. Then I will know you love Angus&#8221;&mdash;and
he tried gently to draw her closer to him. &#8220;Just one
kiss, darling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na! Na,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;That canna be.
I&#8217;m a fisher-lass, and we hae a law we dinna break&mdash;we
keep our lips virgin pure, for the lad we mean
to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very hard and cruel. You send me
away almost broken-hearted. May I write to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll tell me about a&#8217; the wonderfuls you
see, I&#8217;ll be gey glad to hear from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then farewell, my love! Do not forget me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not likely I&#8217;ll forget you,&#8221; and her voice
trembled, as she whispered &#8220;Farewell!&#8221; and gave
him her hand. He stooped, and kissed it. Then
he turned away.</p>
<p>She watched him till in the dim distance she saw
him raise his hat and then disappear. Still she stood,
until the roll of the carriage wheels gradually became
inaudible. Then she knew that she was weeping,
and she wiped her eyes, and turned them upon
the light in the cottage burning for her. And she
thought tenderly of her lover, and whispered to
her heart&mdash;&#8220;If he had only come back! I might
hae given him a kiss. Puir laddie! Puir, dear laddie!
His uncle has heard tell o&#8217; the fisher-lassie,
and he&#8217;s ta&#8217;en him awa&#8217; from Christine&mdash;but he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
his ain master&mdash;sae it&#8217;s his ain fault! Christine is
o&#8217;er gude for anyone who can be wiled awa&#8217; by man,
or woman, or pleasure, or gold. I&#8217;ll be first, or I&#8217;ll
be naething at a&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>She found her father alone, and wide awake.
&#8220;Where is Mither?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got her to go to bed. She was weary and full
o&#8217; pain. Keep a close watch on your mither,
Christine. The trouble in her heart grows warse,
I fear. Wha was wi&#8217; you in your hame-comin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angus Ballister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the last time he will be wi&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that sae? It is just as weel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is awa&#8217; wi&#8217; his Uncle Ballister, for a year or
mair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he thinking you&#8217;ll wait, while he looks o&#8217;er
the women-folk in the rest o&#8217; the warld?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems sae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You liked him weel enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiles&mdash;weel enough for a lover on trial. But
what would a lass do wi&#8217; a husband wha could leave
her for a year on his ain partic&#8217;lar pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kent you wad act wiselike, when the time came
to act. There&#8217;s nae men sae true as fishermen. They
hae ane dear woman to love, and she&#8217;s the only
woman in the warld for them. Now Cluny&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We willna speak o&#8217; Cluny, Feyther. Both you
and Mither, specially Mither, are far out o&#8217; your
usual health. What for did God gie you a daughter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
if it wasna to be a comfort and help to you,
when you needed it? I&#8217;m no carin&#8217; to marry any
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please God, you arena fretting anent Angus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for would I fret? He was a grand lover
while he lasted. But when a man is feared to honor
his love with his name, a lass has a right to despise
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sae! But you mustna fret yoursel&#8217; sick
after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me! Not likely!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was bonnie enou&#8217;, and he had siller&mdash;plenty
o&#8217; siller!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no&#8217; thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; the siller, Feyther! Na, na,
siller isn&#8217;t in the matter, but&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;When your lover rins over the sea,</p>
<p class='indent2'>He may never come back again;</p>
<p>But this, or that, will na matter to me,</p>
<p class='indent2'>For my heart! My heart is my ain!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Then a&#8217;s weel, lassie. I&#8217;ll just creep into Neil&#8217;s

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />CHRISTINE AND ANGUS</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>They did not separate, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>A sorrow we have looked in the face, can harm us no more.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Perhaps</span> Christine was not so brave as
her father thought, but she had considered the
likelihood of such a situation, and had decided
that there was no dealing with it, except in a spirit of
practical life. She knew, also, that in the long run
sentiment would have to give way to common sense,
and the more intimate she became with the character
of Angus Ballister, the more certain she felt that
his love for her would have to measure itself against
the pride and will of his uncle, and the tyranny of
social estimates and customs.</p>
<p>She was therefore not astonished that Angus had
left both himself and her untrammeled by promises.
He was a young man who never went to meet finalities,
especially if there was anything unpleasant or
serious in them; and marriage was a finality full of
serious consequences, even if all its circumstances
were socially proper. And what would Society say,
if Angus Ballister made a fisher-girl his wife!</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasna wise to hae this, or that, to do wi&#8217; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
lad,&#8221; she whispered, and then after a few moments&#8217;
reflection, she added, &#8220;nor was I altogether selfish
i&#8217; the matter. Neil relied on me making a friend
o&#8217; him, and Mither told me she knew my guid sense
wad keep the lad in his proper place. Weel, I hae
done what was expected o&#8217; me, and what&#8217;s the end
o&#8217; the matter, Christine? Ye hae a sair heart, lass,
an&#8217; if ye arena in love wi&#8217; a lad that can ne&#8217;er mak&#8217;
you his wife, ye are precariously near to it.&#8221; Then
she was silent, while lacing her shoes, but when this
duty was well finished, she continued, &#8220;The lad has
gien me many happy hours, and Christine will never
be the one to say, or even think, wrang o&#8217; him; we
were baith in the fault&mdash;if it be a fault&mdash;as equally
in the fault, as the fiddle and the fiddlestick are in
the music. Weel, then what&#8217;s to do? Duty stands
high above pleasure, an&#8217; I must gie my heart to duty,
an&#8217; my hands to duty, even if I tread pleasure underfoot
in the highway in the doin&#8217; o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she made these resolutions, some strong instinctive
feeling induced her to dress herself in clean
clothing from head to feet, and then add bright
touches of color, and the glint of golden ornaments
to her attire. &#8220;I hae taken a new mistress this morning,&#8221;
she said, as she clasped her gold beads around
her white throat&mdash;&#8220;and I&#8217;ll show folk that I&#8217;m not
fretting mysel&#8217; anent the auld one.&#8221; And in some
unreasoning, occult way, this fresh, bright clothing
strengthened her.</p>
<p>Indeed, Margot was a little astonished when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
saw her daughter. Her husband had told her in a
few words just how matters now lay between Ballister
and Christine, and she was fully prepared with
sympathy and counsels for the distracted, or angry,
girl she expected to meet. So Christine&#8217;s
beaming face, cheerful voice, and exceptional dress
astonished her. &#8220;Lassie!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Whatna
for hae you dressed yoursel&#8217; sae early in the
day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought o&#8217; going into the toun, Mither. I require
some worsted for my knitting. I&#8217;m clean out
o&#8217; all sizes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wanting you to go to the manse this morning.
I am feared for the pain in my breast, dearie,
and the powders the Domine gies me for it are gane.
I dinna like to be without them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go for them, Mither, this morning, as soon
as I think the Domine is out o&#8217; his study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be contented. How are you feeling
yoursel&#8217;, Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, Mither!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas a grand ploy last night. That lad, Angus
Ballister, danced with a&#8217; and sundry, and sang, and
ate wi&#8217; the best, and the worst o&#8217; us. I was hearing
he was going awa&#8217; for a year or mair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, to foreign parts. Rich young men think
they arena educated unless they get a touch o&#8217; France
or Italy, and even America isna out o&#8217; their way.
You wad think a Scotch university wad be the complement
o&#8217; a Scotch gentleman!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Did he bid you good-by? Or is he coming here
today?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isna likely to ever come here again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for no? He&#8217;s been fain and glad to come
up here. What&#8217;s changed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isna changed. He has to go wi&#8217; his uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say about marrying you? He ought
to hae asked your feyther for ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say such words, Mither. There was no
talk of marriage between us. What would Angus
do with a girl like me for a wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are gude enou&#8217; for any man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are friends. We arena lovers. The lad has
been friendly with the hale village. You mustna
think wrang o&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think vera wrang o&#8217; him. He is just one
kind o&#8217; a scoundrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hurt me, Mither. Angus is my friend. I&#8217;ll
think nae wrang o&#8217; him. If he was wrang, I was
wrang, and you should hae told me I was wrang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was feared o&#8217; hurting Neil&#8217;s chances wi&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sae we baith had a second motive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, few folk are moved by a single one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angus came, and he went, he liked me, and I
liked him, but neither o&#8217; us will fret o&#8217;er the parting.
It had to be, or it wouldn&#8217;t hae been. Them above
order such things. They sort affairs better than we
could.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re up to, but I think
you are acting vera unwomanly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, Mither! I&#8217;ll not play &#8216;maiden all forlorn&#8217;
for anyone. If Angus can live without me,
there isna a woman i&#8217; the world that can live without
Angus as weel as Christine Ruleson can. Tuts!
I hae you, Mither, and my dear feyther, and my six
big brothers, and surely their love is enough for any
soul through this life; forbye, there is the love beyond
all, and higher than all, and truer than all&mdash;the
love of the Father and the Son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see ye hae made up your mind to stand by
Ballister. Vera weel! Do sae! As long as he
keeps himsel&#8217; in foreign pairts, he&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er fret me;
but if he comes hame, he&#8217;ll hae to keep a few hundred
miles atween us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! We&#8217;ll a&#8217; be glad to see him hame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your way be it. Get your eating done wi&#8217;, and
then awa&#8217; to the manse, and get me thae powders.
I&#8217;m restless and feared if I have none i&#8217; the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be awa&#8217; in ten minutes now. Ye ken the
Domine doesna care for seeing folk till after ten
o&#8217;clock. He says he hes ither company i&#8217; the first
hours o&#8217; daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like enou&#8217;, but he&#8217;ll be fain to hear about the
doings last night, and he&#8217;ll be pleased concerning
Faith getting a sweetheart. I doubt if she deserves
the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither! Dinna say that. The puir lassie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Puir lassie indeed! Her feyther left her forty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
pounds a year, till she married, and then the principal
to do as she willed wi&#8217;. I dinna approve o&#8217;
women fretting and fearing anent naething.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if they hae the fret and fear, what are they
to do wi&#8217; it, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight it. Fighting is better than fearing. Weel,
tak&#8217; care o&#8217; yoursel&#8217; and mind every word that you
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going by the cliffs on the sea road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will keep you langer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but I&#8217;ll no require to mind my words. I&#8217;ll
meet naebody on that road to talk wi&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not say that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>A suspicion at once had entered Margot&#8217;s heart.
&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she mused, as she watched Christine out
of sight&mdash;&#8220;I wonder if she is trysted wi&#8217; Angus Ballister
on the cliff road. Na, na, she would hae told
me, whether or no, she would hae told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The solitude of the sea, and of the lonely road,
was good for Christine. She was not weeping, but
she had a bitter aching sense of something lost. She
thought of her love lying dead outside her heart&#8217;s
shut door, and she could not help pitying both love
and herself. &#8220;He was like sunshine on my life,&#8221; she
sighed. &#8220;It is dark night now. All is over.
Good-by forever, Angus! Oh, Love, Love!&#8221; she
cried aloud to the sea. &#8220;Oh, you dear old troubler
o&#8217; the warld! I shall never feel young again. Weel,
weel, Christine, I&#8217;ll not hae ye going to meet trouble,
it isna worth the compliment. Angus may forget me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and find some ither lass to love&mdash;weel, then, if it
be so, let it be so. I&#8217;ll find the right kind o&#8217; strength
for every hour o&#8217; need, and the outcome is sure to be
right. God is love. Surely that is a&#8217; I need. I&#8217;ll
just leave my heartache here, the sea can carry it
awa&#8217;, and the winds blow it far off&#8221;&mdash;and she began
forthwith a tender little song, that died down every
few bars, but was always lifted again, until it
swelled out clear and strong, as she came in sight of
the small, white manse, standing bravely near the
edge of a cliff rising sheerly seven hundred feet
above the ocean. The little old, old kirk, with its
lonely acres full of sailors&#8217; graves, was close to it,
and Christine saw that the door stood wide open,
though it was yet early morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a wedding, a stranger wedding,&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;Hame folk wouldna be sae thoughtless,
as to get wed in the morning&mdash;na, na, it will be some
stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>These speculations were interrupted by the
Domine&#8217;s calling her, and as soon as she heard his
voice, she saw him standing at the open door.
&#8220;Christine!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Come in! Come in! I
want you, lassie, very much. I was just wishing for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad that I answered your wish, Sir. I
would aye like to do that, if it be His will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come straight to my study, dear. You are a
very godsend this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went hurriedly into the house, and turned towards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
his study, and Christine followed him. And
before she crossed the threshold of the room, she
saw Angus and his Uncle Ballister, sitting at a table
on which there were books and papers.</p>
<p>Angus rose to meet her at once. He did it as an
involuntary act. He did not take a moment&#8217;s counsel
or consideration, but sprang to his feet with the
joyful cry of a delighted boy. And Christine&#8217;s face
reflected the cry in a wonderful, wonderful smile.
Then Angus was at her side, he clasped her hands,
he called her by her name in a tone of love and
music, he drew her closer to his side. And the elder
man smiled and looked at the Domine, who remembered
then the little ceremony he had forgotten.</p>
<p>So he took Christine by the hand, and led her to
the stranger, and in that moment a great change
came into the countenance and manner of the girl,
while a peculiar light of satisfaction&mdash;almost of
amusement&mdash;gleamed in her splendid eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Ballister,&#8221; said the Domine, &#8220;I present
to you Miss Christine Ruleson, the friend of your
nephew, the beloved of the whole village of Culraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to make Miss Ruleson&#8217;s acquaintance,&#8221;
he replied and Christine said,</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great pleasure to meet you, Sir. When
you know Angus, you wish to know the man who
made Angus well worth the love he wins.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Domine and Angus looked at the beautiful
girl in utter amazement. She spoke perfect English,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
in the neat, precise, pleasant manner and intonation
of the Aberdeen educated class. But something
in Christine&#8217;s manner compelled their silence.
She willed it, and they obeyed her will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down at the table with us, Christine,&#8221; said
the Domine. &#8220;We want your advice;&#8221; and she had
the good manners to sit down, without affectations
or apologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel, will you tell your own tale? There&#8217;s
none can do it like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is thus, and so, Miss Ruleson. Two nights
ago as I sat thinking of Angus in Culraine, I remembered
my own boyhood days in the village. I
thought of the boats, and the sailors, and the happy
hours out at sea with the nets, or the lines. I remembered
how the sailors&#8217; wives petted me, and as
I grew older teased me, and sang to me. And I
said to my soul, &#8216;We have been ungratefully neglectful,
Soul, and we will go at once, and see if any of
the old playfellows are still alive.&#8217; So here I am,
and though I find by the Domine&#8217;s kirk list that only
three of my day are now in Culraine, I want to do
some good thing for the place. The question is,
what. Angus thinks, as my memories are all of
playtime, I might buy land for a football field, or
links for a golf club. What do you say to this idea,
Miss Ruleson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can say naething in its favor, Sir. Fishers are
hard-worked men; they do not require to play hard,
and call it amusement. I have heard my father say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
that ball games quickly turn to gambling games. A
game of any sort would leave all the women out.
Their men are little at home, and it would be a
heartache to them, if they took to spending that little
in a ball field, or on the golf links.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their wives might go with them, Christine,&#8221; said
Angus.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would require to leave many home duties,
if they did so. It would not be right&mdash;our women
would not do it. Once I was at St. Andrews, and I
wanted to go to the golf links with my father, but
the good woman with whom we were visiting said:
<ins title='Changed from double quote'>&#8216;James</ins> Ruleson, go to the links if so be you want to
go, but you&#8217;ll no daur to tak&#8217; this young lassie there.
The language on the links is just awfu&#8217;. It isna fit
for a decent lass to hear. No, Sir, golf links would
be of no use to the women, and their value is very
uncertain to <ins title='Guessing at end single quote'>men.&#8217;&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;Women&#8217;s presence would doubtless make men
more careful in their language,&#8221; said Angus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Angus, it would be doing what my Mither
ca&#8217;s &#8216;letting the price o&#8217;er-gang the profit.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ruleson&#8217;s objections are good and valid,
and we admit them,&#8221; said the Colonel; &#8220;perhaps she
will now give us some idea we can work out&#8221;&mdash;and
when he looked at her for response, he caught his
breath at the beauty and sweetness of the face before
him. &#8220;What are you thinking of?&#8221; he asked,
almost with an air of humility, for the visible presence
of goodness and beauty could hardly have affected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
him more. And Christine answered softly:
&#8220;I was thinking of the little children.&#8221; And the
three men felt ashamed, and were silent. &#8220;I was
thinking of the little children,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;how
they have neither schoolhouse, nor playhouse. They
must go to the town, if they go to school; and there
is the bad weather, and sickness, and busy mothers,
and want of clothing and books, and shoes, and
slates, and the like. Our boys and girls get at the
Sunday School all the learning they have. The poor
children. They have hard times in a fishing-village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have given us the best of advice, Miss Ruleson,
and we will gladly follow it,&#8221; said the Colonel.
&#8220;I am sure you are right. I will build a good schoolhouse
in Culraine. I will begin it at once. It shall
be well supplied with books and maps, and I will pay
a good teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a man teacher, Sir. They have small patience
with little children. They will use the taws
on baby hands, that cannot make a &#8216;k&#8217; or a &#8216;z&#8217; at first
sight. Give them a woman teacher, who will not be
afraid of the bairnies snuggling into her arms, and
telling her all their little troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Domine,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;we have received
our orders. What say you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say a school, by all means, Sir. To the children
of Culraine it will be a dispensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First, we must have land for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking, as you spoke, of James Ruleson&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
land. It lies at the foot of his hill, and would be
the very best location for a schoolhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will see James Ruleson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father is line-fishing now. He will not be home
until five o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;If possible, we will see him after five. Come,
Domine, let us have a look through the old kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it standing open,&#8221; said Christine, &#8220;and I
was thinking there might be a strange wedding there
today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Christine. It was opened for the Colonel,
though there are no Ballister effigies in it. If
it was an old English kirk, there would be knights
and crusaders, and soldiers lying there, in stone
state. We do not like images in our kirks. The
second command stands clean against it. Come with
us, Christine, and when we return I will give you
the medicine your mother requires.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the Domine and the Colonel led the way, and
Angus and Christine followed. And when they
reached the kirkyard, Angus said, &#8220;Stand here a
moment, you dear, dear girl, and tell me how you
could talk to my uncle in the high English of Aberdeen.
It was beautiful! How did you acquire
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through long years of practice, Angus. I heard
all Neil&#8217;s lessons, and I always spoke the English,
when I was with Neil. He didna like me to speak
Scotch, because he was feared of spoiling his English.
It was our home secret, for it would have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
a great offense, if I had used English in the village.
You can see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They dinna mind the Domine speaking English,
yet if he particularly wants them to do anything, he
is maist sure to drop into the most familiar Scotch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil must have had great influence over you,
Christine,&#8221; and Angus said the words disagreeably.
He was feeling jealous of any influences but his own
controlling Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I always did what he told me to do. Step
softly, Angus. The Domine is talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached the Domine&#8217;s side, they found
him turning the leaves of a very old Bible. &#8220;You
see, Colonel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my father gave me The
Book when I first came here. My ancestors have
preached from it since A.D. 1616. It came to me
through a long succession of good men. It has been
my close, personal friend ever since. The finest
Bible in Scotland could not take its place. There are
pages in it that have been luminous to me. I have
seen the glory shining out of the black letters. There
are pages in it so sensitive to me that I feel a special
spiritual emanation from them. I will be glad of
a new cushion for The Book, for the one on which
it now lies is worn and shabby, and that ought not
to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I cannot give you a new Bible, even for
the church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible! I could not preach from a new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
Bible. Colonel, it is not a book, it is a friend. We
have secrets together. I have promises from it, that
are yet owing me. It holds our confidences for
thirty years. Sometimes I think it really speaks to
me. Sometimes a glory seems to shine over the page
I am reading, and my soul is so happy, that my
tongue speaks aloud joyfully the shining words that
have been given me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not separate you from such a Bible, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be grateful if you give me a new cushion
for it. Nothing is too good for The Book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they stood looking thoughtfully over the
bare place. It had an old, past look. It was plain
and moldy, and needed repairing in every way. The
Colonel made a note of what was required in the
nave of the kirk, and then glanced upward. The
gallery appeared to be in still worse condition, but
in front of it there was a wonderfully beautiful
model of a full-rigged ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed the Colonel, &#8220;a ship instead of
a clock! Is that right, Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite. I put it there. It was made by a sailor
lad born in Culraine, who came here to die. Long,
painful, hopeless days were soothed by the fashioning
of that miniature ship. All the village watched
its progress, all felt an interest in the dying lad.
He finished it on the eve of his death. Young and
old came to bid him good-by, and to see his white,
trembling hands dress the topmost spar, and fly the
blue Peter. &#8216;I am just about to sail,&#8217; he said, &#8216;sae
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
I&#8217;ll up wi&#8217; the blue Peter. That means I&#8217;m ready
to go. Let her carry it till I&#8217;m safely hame.&#8217; I put
a new Peter on the top-mast last year,&#8221; said the
Domine, and his eyes filled with tears, as he looked
steadfastly at the emblem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seem to expect a clock in the front of the
gallery, Sir. Can a ship take its place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing, could be more appropriate.
The favorite image of the church in all ages has been
a ship, or a boat. The first preaching was connected
with a ship, for while Noah builded the ark,
he preached repentance. The holiest object of the
Jewish tabernacle was the ark, made like a boat.
All Christ&#8217;s known life is associated with boats. The
favorite image of the early persecuted church was a
boat beaten by the winds and waves, and our own
churches preserve everywhere this world-wide idea,
by calling the body of the church the nave, from
navis, a ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very interesting information, Sir,&#8221; said
Angus.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to Venice, Ballister; you will find
many of the oldest churches in Venice built in the
shape of a ship; and near Lisbon there is a chapel
of marble, with pillars like masts, and its sails and
cordage carved on the walls. Is not this life a voyage
to the eternal shores, and what could typify our
safety better than a ship with Christ for the captain
of our salvation? You see, I will still be preaching.
I make no excuse.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>&#8220;None is necessary. We are glad to listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come now, Christine, and I will give you medicine
for your mother. Gentlemen, in a few minutes
I will return here.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they were alone the Domine said: &#8220;Christine,
you did wisely, and your speech was correct
and beautiful, but I would advise you to keep your
English for special occasions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, not even my father and mother know I can
drop the Scotch. When the time comes to tell them,
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. And the villagers? It might be an
offense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak as if you had learned to speak at the
Maraschal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I learned it from Neil. We
always talked it together, for Neil hated the
dialect, and I made a bargain wi&#8217; him. I promised
to talk as he taught me, if he would keep the
circumstance from everyone. He said he would,
and he has stood by his promise. Sae have I,
but I hae been talking English nearly five years
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonderful woman! Then this morning you
gave yourself away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to do it&mdash;I couldna resist the want.
And it was only to you, and the twa Ballisters. Nane
o&#8217; you three will go blabbing. Anyway, when Neil
leaves the Maraschal, he will care little how I talk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
He&#8217;ll hae finer folk than Christine, to crack and
claver wi&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will not find finer folk easily. Now run
home as quickly as you can, and prepare your father
and mother for the Ballister visit. I will come with
him, and ask your mother to have a cup of tea by
the fire for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will Angus be wi&#8217; ye, Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I am going to send him to the factor&#8217;s,
and also to Lawyer Semple&#8217;s. You need not be
looking for him. Try and leave well alone. It is
hard to make well better, and it is very easy to make
it worse. If you hurry a little, I think you may be
home by twelve o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Christine hurried a little, and reached home
by the noon hour. Her dinner was ready, and her
father very unexpectedly was sitting by the fireside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feyther,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I hope you arena sick,&#8221; and
then she smiled at the inquiry, for his broad, rosy
face was the very picture of robust health.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick! Na, na, lassie! I&#8217;m weel enou&#8217;, but Norman
was feeling badly. His arm hurts him sairly,
and I was noticing that the fish had gane to deep
waters. We&#8217;ll hae a storm before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Christine served the dinner waiting for her,
and while they were eating, she told the great news
of a school for Culraine. Ruleson was quickly enthusiastic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Margot, out of pure contradiction, deplored
the innovation.</p>
<p>The walk to the toun, she said, was gude for the
childer. If they were too tired to learn after it, it
showed that learning was beyond their capabilities,
and that they would be better making themsel&#8217;s
usefu&#8217; at hame. And what were women with large
families to do without their big lads to bring water
to wash wi&#8217;, and their half-grown lasses to tak&#8217; care
o&#8217; the babies, and help wi&#8217; the cooking and cleaning?</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Margot,&#8221; said Ruleson, &#8220;think o&#8217; the outcome
for the childer&mdash;&mdash;Think o&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye dinna require to tell me the outcome. As
soon as the childer get what they ca&#8217; an education,
they hurry awa&#8217; to some big city, or foreign country,
and that&#8217;s the end o&#8217; them. Settle a school here,
and I&#8217;ll tell you the plain result&mdash;in a few years
we&#8217;ll hae neither lads nor boats, and the lasses now
growing up will hae to go to Largo, or to some unkent
place for husbands. Gie our lads books, and
you&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er get them into the boats. That&#8217;s a fact!
I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Between Margot and Christine the argument continued
all afternoon, but Ruleson went to the foot
of the hill, and looked at the land proposed for
the site of the future school. He was glad that it
was his land, and he was so much of a natural poet
that he could see the white building, and the boys
and girls trooping in and out of its wide doors. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
the vision of the children playing together there was
so clear to his imagination, that he carefully stepped
off the acres he supposed would give them sufficient
room for their games; and then shutting his eyes
that he might see better, he decided that it was too
small, and so stepped off another acre.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er scrimp the childer, God bless them!&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;for it will be a happy day to James
Ruleson, when he sees them runnin&#8217; to these acres
wi&#8217; books and balls in their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went home, and Margot said something
about his Sunday claes, but James did not heed her.
He put on a clean shirt, and a suit of blue flannel.
His shirt was open at the throat, his feet were in
boots that reached nearly to his knees. But he had
a grandly satisfied look, and the beautiful courtesy
of men who as a rule think only good of their neighbors,
and do only good to them.</p>
<p>Margot, like Christine, was in her fisher-costume,
with little accentuations in Christine&#8217;s case; but
Margot was the very mate for the splendid man she
called &#8220;her man.&#8221; Scotch, from head to feet, douce
and domestic, yet cleverer than James, though
obedient to him&mdash;a good woman, fit for the work of
this world, and not forgetful concerning a better
one.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the Domine&#8217;s directions about
a cup of tea, Christine laid the table with their best
linen and china, and though no difference was made
in the food provided, Christine saw that it was well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
cooked. After all, it was quite an event for James
Ruleson, and in the outcome of it he expected to
realize one of the greatest pleasures that could come
to him.</p>
<p>About five o&#8217;clock the Domine and Ballister arrived.
They entered a room full of the feeling of
home. It was clean, and white as a snow drift, and
there was a bright fire blazing on the hearth. The
covered table with its knives and forks and spoons,
and its gilt rimmed teacups, was in itself a symbol of
hospitality. The Domine looked at it, and then
said, &#8220;Margot, you are baking sea trout. I told you
never to do that again, when I was coming, unless
you intended asking me to help in the eating of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, they were cooked special for you, Sir,
and I hope you will hae the good will to pleasure me
in the eating o&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Margot, certainly! I could not resist
your invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Ruleson rose, and said,
&#8220;Colonel, if you will join the Domine at the meal
God has gi&#8217;en us, James Ruleson will gladly break
bread with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>After these preliminaries, Christine served the
meal, and then waited on her parents and their
guests. They ate the fish with great enjoyment. It
was to the Colonel a gastronomical discovery. No
anchovy, no sauces of any kind, just the delicate fish,
baked with a few slices of Ayrshire ham, and served
with potatoes boiled in their jackets so skillfully that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the jackets dropped from them when touched. It
was a dish pure and simple, and captivated every
palate. Nothing more was needed that Christine&#8217;s
quiet service and the animated conversation did not
supply. As to Margot, she was kept busy filling
small cups with that superexcellent tea we get in
Scotland, and find it next to impossible to get anywhere
else.</p>
<p>After the fish was fully eaten, Christine&mdash;almost
without notice&mdash;cleared the table, and brought on a
rice pudding, and a large pitcher of cream. The
men ate the whole of it. Perhaps they did so unconsciously,
for they were talking about the school in
an enthusiastic manner, while it was disappearing.
Then James Ruleson lit his pipe, and the Colonel his
cigar, and they sat down at the fireside. The
Domine, with a smile of perfect happiness, sat between
them, and every remnant of dinner silently
disappeared.</p>
<p>During the hour following the Domine drafted
the principal items to be discussed and provided for,
and it was further resolved to call a village meeting
in the Fishers&#8217; Hall, for the next evening. Then
the Colonel&#8217;s carriage was waiting, and he rose, but
really with some reluctance. He cast his eyes over
the comfortable room, and looked with admiration
on the good man who called it home, on the bright,
cheery woman, whose love made it worth the name,
and on the girl who filled it with her beauty; and
he said to Margot, &#8220;Mrs. Ruleson, I have eaten today
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the very best of dinners. I enjoyed every mouthful
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, the dinner was good, Colonel; and we
were proud and glad o&#8217; your company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will meet us in the Hall tomorrow
night, and bring all the women you can with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, Sir, but our women are a dour
lot. They lay out their ain way, and then mak&#8217; the
taking o&#8217; it a point o&#8217; duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>And all the way to Ballister House the Colonel
wondered about his dinner&mdash;no flowers on the table,
no napkins, no finger bowls, no courses, no condiments
or pickles, no wine, not even a thimbleful of
whiskey, nothing but excellently cooked fresh fish
and potatoes, a good cup of tea with it, and then a
rice pudding and plenty of cream. &#8220;Wonderful!&#8221;
he ejaculated. &#8220;Upon my word, things are more
evenly balanced than we think. I know noblemen
and millionaires that are far from being as happy,
or as well fed, as Ruleson&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning the bellman went through the
village calling men and women together at half-past
seven, in the Fishers&#8217; Hall; and there was great excitement
about the matter. Even the boys and girls
here took a noisy part in the discussion, for and
against, the argument in this class being overwhelmingly
in favor of the school.</p>
<p>Among the adults, opinion was also divided.
There were lazy mothers who could not do without
their girls&#8217; help, and greedy fathers who expected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
their little lads to make, or at least save them a few
shillings a week; and Christine feared the gift would
be ungraciously taken. Ruleson had a long talk with
big Peter Brodie, and Peter told him not to fash
himsel&#8217; anent a lot o&#8217; ignorant women and men folk.
If they were such fools, as not to ken a blessing
when it was put into their vera hands, they ought to
be made to understand the fact; and with a peculiar
smile he intimated that he would take great satisfaction
in gieing them as many lessons as they required.</p>
<p>The meeting was, however, crowded, and when
the Colonel and the Domine stepped on the platform,
the audience were just in the mood to give
them a rousing cheer. It opened the Domine&#8217;s
mouth, and he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, I have great and good news for you.
Colonel Ballister is going to build us a school of
our own. We shall want some of you as Trustees,
and others will have to form an executive board.
We are going to have a women&#8217;s board as well. The
men&#8217;s board will look after the management of the
school. The women&#8217;s board will look after the
bairns, and see that they get fair play in every respect.
A women&#8217;s board will be a new thing, but
Culraine is not afraid of new ways, if they be better
ways.&#8221; Then he went into particulars, which we
need not do, and concluded by telling them that
James Ruleson had given land both for the school
and the playground, and that it was hoped James&#8217;
approval would stand for many, and much. &#8220;We will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
now take the vote of both men and women for, or
against, the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a man in the center of the crowded hall
stood up. It was Peter Brodie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a vote is outside necessity.
We dinna vote as to whether we want sunshine, or
fish, or bread. We are sure o&#8217; the matter. The
school is mental bread and meat and sunshine to
our lads and lasses. We thank God for it. There
would be a deal o&#8217; trouble i&#8217; getting and counting
names, and the like o&#8217; that. Let us vote, gentlemen,
as our forefathers voted for the Solemn League
and Covenant, by just lifting their right hands above
their heads. The Domine could gie us the word,
and if after it there is man or woman with baith
hands down, Peter Brodie will be asking the reason
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>This speech was received with acclamation, and
when the tumult had subsided, the Domine called
for the silent vote of approval, that had ratified their
immortal compact with their kirk. He described in
picturesque words that wonderful scene in the Greyfriars&#8217;
kirkyard, when sixty thousand right hands
rose as promptly as one hand for the True Religion,
and he told them that after the kirk, their first duty
was the school. Then he stood still a moment, and
there was a profound silence. After it came the
word:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand!&#8221;</p>
<p>Men and women rose as by one impulse.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Those who are in favor of a school in Culraine,
and grateful to God and man for it, let them lift up
their right hands above their heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every right hand was lifted. There was not a
protesting hand, and Peter Brodie observed that
if there had been one, it ought to be cut off, and
cast into the fire, with a&#8217; the lave o&#8217; useless members.</p>
<p>The meeting was then practically over, but many
remained. The room was warm and lighted, and it
seemed unreasonable not to have a song and story,
and dance out of it. Christine was entreated to remain,
but she said her mither wasna feeling well,
and she be to gae hame wi&#8217; her. In truth she was
much depressed because Angus had not come with
his uncle. She did not like to ask why, and her heart
was full of unhappy surmises. But she put the trouble
aside while with her mother, and gave herself
willingly to the discussion of Peter Brodie&#8217;s ill-bred
and forwardsome behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;I perfectly thought shame of his interference,&#8221;
said Margot. &#8220;Mercifully he spoke some kind o&#8217;
Scotch, for I hae heard him&mdash;special when he was
angry&mdash;rave in his native Gaelic, and then he got his
ain way, for nae decent man or woman could answer
his unpronounceable words. They were just a vain
babblement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Pollok was a&#8217; for the school tonight; this
morning she was raving against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was to be looked for. There is as much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
two-facedness in some women, as there&#8217;s meat in an
egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But for all disputing, Mither, everyone seemed
to think the school would be a good thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is this, and that, and what not, and how it
will end nobody knows. Some folks are ill to please,
even when they get their ain way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could hardly make Mary Leslie keep her
sitting. She wanted to stand up, and ask the Domine
how she was to cook and wash and clean and sew
and nurse her baby, without the help o&#8217; her girls,
Jess and Flora. She said there was eleven in her
family, and she wanted to know how it was to be
managed. It was hard to keep her still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was vera barefaced o&#8217; her. But she put up
her hand wi&#8217; the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Mither. She was feared for Peter Brodie
quarreling with her man. That&#8217;s Peter&#8217;s way o&#8217;
managing women; he mak&#8217;s their husbands responsible
for a&#8217; they say, and do; he says, &#8216;the husbands
ought to hae brought up their wives better.&#8217; He has
done it, you know, Mither, several times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot laughed. &#8220;Ay,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for Tamson&#8217;s
wife. Naebody blamed him. Anne Tamson has a
parfectly unruly tongue, and her husband, Watty,
got the licking for what she said anent Frazer and
his wife. I wouldna fear the man mysel&#8217;, and the
maist o&#8217; our women could gie him as much&mdash;and
mair&mdash;than he sends.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they talked until the cottage was reached, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
the day was over. Christine went gladly to her
room. A crusie was burning on the table, and she
removed her gown and uncoiled her long, brown
hair. Then all was still, and she let herself think,
and her decision was, &#8220;if Angus had wanted to come,
he would have done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isna my place,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;to tak&#8217; care
on the subject. I&#8217;ll no mak&#8217; mysel&#8217; and ithers miserable
anent him, forbye Angus Ballister is clear
outside me, and my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose and took a large copy book from
a drawer, and sitting down at the table, took pen
and ink and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>November second. I was a little troubled all day about
Angus. He didna come, and he didna send, and there was
neither sign nor sight o&#8217; him. Weel, my warld went on
wanting the lad, and the school talk filled the day, and at
night I went wi&#8217; Mither to the meeting about it. From this
hour I begin to forget Angus. I will ask God to keep my
heart from all love&#8217;s care and sorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she put the book away, turned out the light
and lay down. But the old mysterious, hungering
sound of the sea had an angry sough in it; and she
went to sleep fearing it, and thinking of it as a deep
starless darkness, hanging over the dreamlike figures
of dead sailors and fishers. At midnight she awoke,
the storm her father had predicted was roaring over
the great waters. She went to her little window and
looked out&mdash;darkness, wildness, desolation&mdash;and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
hasted and put plenty of peats on the fire, and carried
her mother an extra quilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae made up the fire, Mither dear,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and if ye want to get up, you&#8217;ll be warm, and I&#8217;ll
come and sit by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I waken your feyther?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatna for? There&#8217;s naething to fear. Norman
and Eneas are doubtless at hame. Most o&#8217; our
men are. Few would start after the dance. They
would see the storm coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it be a bad storm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it will. But the sea is His, and He made
it. If there is a storm He is guiding it. Ye ken
how often we sing &#8216;He plants His footsteps on the
sea, and rides upon the storm.&#8217;&#8221; And so, sweet-eyed
and fearless, she went away, but left peace and
blessing behind her.</p>
<p>In the living room, she laid more peats on the
fire. Then she went to her own room. Some words
had been singing in her heart as she moved about,
and she took the big copy book out of the drawer,
and stooping to the crusie burning on the table, she
wrote them down:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>The night is black, the winds are wild,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The waves are taking their own will,</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, sleeping like a child,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Awake! and bid the storm be still.</p>
</div></div>
<p>She read the words over with a smile. &#8220;They might
be worse,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;but Christine! You hae
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
been writing poetry. You&#8217;ll hae to stop that nonsense!
Weel, it wasna my fault. It came o&#8217; itsel&#8217;,
and I dinna feel as if I had done anything much out
o&#8217; the way&mdash;and I was maist asleep, if that is ony
kind o&#8217; an excuse. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='center'>Because I am,</p>
<p>Thy clay that weeps, thy dust that cares,</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Love, thou knowest, is full of jealousy.</p>
<p>Love&#8217;s reasons are without reason.</p>
</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> summer had been full of interest and excitement,
but it was over. There was the infallible
sense of ended summer, even at noonday;
and the dahlias and hollyhocks, dripping in the
morning mist, seemed to be weeping for it. If it
had been clear cold weather, the fishers would have
been busy and happy, but it was gloomy, with black
skies over the black sea, and bitter north winds that
lashed the waves into fury. The open boats hardly
dared to venture out, and the fish lay low, and were
shy of bait.</p>
<p>James Ruleson, generally accompanied by Cluny
Macpherson, was out every day that a boat could
live on the sea, and Margot and Christine often
stood together at their door or window, and watched
them with anxious hearts, casting their lines in the
lonely, leaden-colored sea. The boat would be one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
minute on the ridge of the billow, the next minute
in the trough of the sea, with a wall of water on
either hand of them. And through all, and over
all, the plaintive pipe of the gulls and snipe, the
creaking of the boat&#8217;s cordage, the boom of the
breakers on the shore, the sense and the presence
of danger.</p>
<p>And Christine knew that Cluny was in that danger
for her sake. He had told her on the day after
the storm, as she sat sympathetically by his side, that
he was only waiting for her &#8220;yes or no.&#8221; He said
when she gave him either one or the other, he would
go to the Henderson steamboats, in one case to work
for their future happiness and home, in the other to
get beyond the power of her beauty, so that he might
forget her.</p>
<p>Forget her! Those two words kept Christine uncertain
and unhappy. She could not bear to think
of Cluny&#8217;s forgetting her. Cluny had been part of
all her nineteen years of life. Why must men be so
one or the other? she asked fretfully. Why force
her to an uncertain decision? Why was she so uncertain?
Then she boldly faced the question and
asked herself&mdash;&#8220;Is Angus Ballister the reason?&#8221;
Perhaps so, though she was equally uncertain about
Angus. She feared the almost insurmountable difficulties
between them. Caste, family, social usage
and tradition, physical deficiencies in education and
in all the incidentals of polite life, not to speak of
what many would consider the greatest of all shortcomings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
her poverty. How could two lives so dissimilar
as Angus Ballister&#8217;s and Christine Ruleson&#8217;s
become one?</p>
<p>She asked her mother this question one day, and
Margot stopped beating her oat cakes and answered,
&#8220;Weel, there&#8217;s a&#8217; kinds o&#8217; men, Christine,
and I&#8217;ll no say it is a thing impossible; but I hae
come to the conclusion that in the case o&#8217; Angus and
yoursel&#8217; you wouldna compluter if you lived together
a&#8217; the rest o&#8217; this life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are&mdash;the baity o&#8217; you&mdash;so weel satisfied
wi&#8217; your present mak&#8217; up. That&#8217;s a&#8217;. And it
is a&#8217; that is needfu&#8217; to keep you baith from going
forwarder. There&#8217;s a lump a&#8217; rank cowardice in it,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, do you think I am a coward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All women are frightened by what is said o&#8217;
them, or even likely to be said o&#8217; them. And nae
wonder. Women are far harder judged than men
are. You would think the Ten Commands were not
made for men. Yet if a woman breaks one o&#8217; them,
God&#8217;s sake! what a sinner she is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what you are meaning, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain enou&#8217;. Men are not set down below
notice, if they break the twa first a&#8217; their lives lang,
if so be they pay their deficit to God in gold to the
kirk. How many men do you know, Christine, who
never break the third command? How many men
honor the fourth? As to the fifth, Scots are maistly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
ready to tak&#8217; care o&#8217; their ain folk. The sixth, seventh
and eighth belong to the criminal class, and
ye&#8217;ll allow its maistly made up o&#8217; bad men. Concerning
the ninth command, men are warse than
women, but men call their ill-natured talk politics,
or het&#8217;rodoxy, or some ither grand name; and I&#8217;ll
allow that as soon as they begin to covet their neighbor&#8217;s
house and wife and horses and cattle, they set
to wark, and mak&#8217; money and build a bigger house
than he hes, and get a bonnier wife, and finer-blooded
horses and cattle&mdash;and I&#8217;m not saying
whether they do well or ill&mdash;there is sae much depending
on the outcome o&#8217; prosperity o&#8217; that kind.
But tak&#8217; men as a whole, they leave the Ten Commands
on the shoulders o&#8217; their wives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do the women obey them, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Middling well. They do love God, and they do
go to kirk. They don&#8217;t swear, and as a general thing
they honor their fathers and mothers. They don&#8217;t,
as a rule, murder or steal or tak&#8217; some ither woman&#8217;s
husband awa&#8217; from her. I&#8217;m no clear about
women and the ninth and tenth command. They
are apt to long for whatever is good and beautiful&mdash;and
I don&#8217;t blame them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I was better educated, Mother. I would
be able to decide between Angus and Cluny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you. The key of your life is in your heart,
not in your brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, as may be. In the long run, your feelings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
will decide, and they are likely to be mair sensible
than your reasons. And where love is the because
o&#8217; your inquiry, I&#8217;ll warrant a bit o&#8217; good sense
is best o&#8217; all advisers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is gude sense? How can a girl get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gude sense is the outcome o&#8217; all our senses. As
regards Ballister, ca&#8217; to your decision a bit o&#8217; wholesome
pride. Ye ken what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, weel, Angus is far awa&#8217;, and Cluny is
only waiting the word I canna say, and what will I
do when I hae nae lover at a&#8217;, at a&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you haven&#8217;t what you love, you must love
what you hae. And I fear there is a heart fu&#8217; o&#8217;
cares ready for us to sort. Geordie Sinclair was telling
your father that Neil is flinging a big net i&#8217;
Aberdeen&mdash;dining wi&#8217; rich folk o&#8217; all kinds, and
rinning as close friend wi&#8217; a lad ca&#8217;ed Rath. He
was saying, also, that Rath has lying siller, plenty,
o&#8217; it, and that he is studying law in the same classes
as Neil, at the Maraschal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna see why we should fret oursel&#8217;s anent
Neil dining wi&#8217; rich folk. He was aye talkin&#8217; o&#8217;
his intention to do the same. The mair rich friends
he has, the better; it isna puir folk that go to law.
Neil is casting his net vera prudently, nae doubt.
I&#8217;ll warrant it will be takin&#8217; for him even while
he sleeps. Worry is just wasted on Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking that way mysel&#8217;, but feyther is
feared he will be spending money he shouldna
spend.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He is lawyer enou&#8217; to ken the outcome o&#8217; that
way. Neil will be on the safe side&mdash;every day, and
always! There&#8217;s nae need to fash oursel&#8217;s anent
Neil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel then, your feyther is sairly heart-hurt
anent Allan&#8217;s youngest laddie. Last New Year
when he went to Glasgow to see Allan, he thought
things were far wrang, and he has worried himsel&#8217;
on the matter ever since. It is a dreadful thing
to say, but the bairn is vera delicate, and his mother
isna kind to him. She is a big strong woman, ne&#8217;er
sick hersel&#8217;, and without feeling for a bairn that is
never well, and often vera sick. Feyther said his
heart was sair for the little fellow, lyin&#8217; wakefu&#8217;
lang nights wi&#8217; pain and fear, and naebody in the
house carin&#8217;. Yesterday feyther hed a letter frae
your brither Allan, and he was fu&#8217; o&#8217; grief, and begging
feyther to go and see the bairn, and if possible
tak&#8217; him to Culraine, and try if we could do anything
to help him to health and happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she let feyther hae him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s as uncertain as the wind, but the lad is
named James after his grandfeyther, and he&#8217;ll ask
for him, on that plea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Mither, get feyther to go at once! I&#8217;ll tak&#8217;
a&#8217; the trouble o&#8217; the child! Only to think o&#8217; it! Only
to think o&#8217; it! A mither no carin&#8217; for her suffering
child!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesna ken what suffering is, hersel&#8217;. She
ne&#8217;er tak&#8217;s cold and she doesna see why ither folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
should. She is never fearsome, or nervous, she
never feels the dark to be full o&#8217; what terrifies her
vera soul, and she canna understand her bairn&#8217;s terror.
She treats him vera much as she treats his
brithers, but they are big, rugged lads, that naething
hurts or frights. All right for them, but she is
slowly killin&#8217; little James, and you couldna mak&#8217; her
see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feyther ought not to lose an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll hae to be vera cautious i&#8217; the matter. Allan&#8217;s
wife isna easily managed. Proud and strong
in her health and youth, she is fairly scounfu&#8217; o&#8217;
the weak and sick, but I think your feyther can
manage her. I&#8217;ll get him awa&#8217; tomorrow, if so be
it&#8217;s possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was such pressure of the two women
brought to bear upon the grandfather&#8217;s heart, that
he was eager for the morning to come, and before
it was yet light he was away to the town, to catch
the earliest train to Edinburgh, from which place
he could get quick transit to Glasgow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mither, we hae done a&#8217; we can, at the
present, for Allan&#8217;s little lad,&#8221; said Christine. &#8220;Do
you think feyther will write to us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he will not. He wad rayther do a
hard day&#8217;s work than write a letter. What are
you going to do wi&#8217; your day, dearie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to write to Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do. You might remind him that his feyther and
mither are yet living in Culraine.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That news isna worth while. If he wants to
write, he&#8217;ll write. If he doesna want to write, we
arena begging letters. I&#8217;m thinking mair o&#8217; little
James than I am o&#8217; Neil. You dinna like his mither,
I&#8217;m thinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking right. Allan picked her up in
some unkent place, and when a man lives between
sailing and docking, he hasna time to ken what
he&#8217;s doing. Forbye, Christine, new relations dinna
get into their place easy. They mind me o&#8217; that
new dress my sister sent me frae Liverpool. It
wanted a lot o&#8217; taking-in, and o&#8217; letting-out. It&#8217;s
just that way wi&#8217; new relations. Allan&#8217;s wife required
plentiful taking-in, and the mair letting-out
there was, the mair unfittable she became.&#8221; Then
Margot rubbed the end of her nose with an air
of scorn, and said decidedly, &#8220;She wasna a comprehensible
woman. I couldna be fashed wi&#8217; her. It
isna the bringing o&#8217; bairns to the birth, that hurts
the heart and spoils the life o&#8217; a mither, it&#8217;s the
way lads and lasses marry themsel&#8217;s that mak&#8217;s her
wish she had neither lad nor lass to her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither, that isna like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allan was just twenty-three when he married
the woman, without word or wittens to any o&#8217; us.
It was a bad day&#8217;s wark, and he hes never been
able to mend it. For there&#8217;s nae takin&#8217;-in or lettin&#8217;-out
wi&#8217; his wife. She is sure she is parfect, and
what will you do, what can you do, wi&#8217; a parfect
woman? I hope and pray that I&#8217;ll never fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
into that state; parfection isna suitable for this
warld.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be a grand virtue, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the warst o&#8217; all the vices. We hae three
or four specimens o&#8217; it in the village o&#8217; Culraine,
and they are the maist unenlightened people we hae
to tak&#8217; care o&#8217;. But when parfection is born o&#8217;
ignorance, it is unconquerable. The Domine said
sae, and that only God could manage a parfect
man or woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When little James comes, wouldn&#8217;t it be well to
hae the Domine look him over? He can tell us
what&#8217;s the matter wi&#8217; the laddie, and what we ought
to do for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a sensible observe, Christine. There
will be nae harm in doing what it calls for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll awa&#8217;, and write to Neil. Hae ye ony
special message for him, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might say I would like to ken something
anent thae Raths. They arena Fifemen, nor Shetlanders,
Highland Scots, nor Lowland Scots; and
I&#8217;m thinking they may be Irish, and if sae, I&#8217;m hopin&#8217;
they hae the true faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither dear, I wouldna fash wi&#8217; the Raths.
They are simply naething to us, and if we set Neil
on &#8216;praising and proving,&#8217; he&#8217;ll write pages anent
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sae he will. You might name the ninety pound
he&#8217;s owing you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldna be advisable. Neil will pay when it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
fully convenient to himsel&#8217;. I&#8217;m not expecting a
farthing until it is sae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can think o&#8217; nae ither thing. It seems vera
superfluous to tell Neil to be good, and to do good.
He has the gift o&#8217; admiring himsel&#8217;. Tell him he
can be thankful, for it isna every man that has the
same capability.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll read you my letter, Mither, when I hae
written it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not. You&#8217;ll say lots I wouldna
say, and naething I would say, and the amends and
contradictions would require another letter o&#8217; explanations.
I&#8217;m going to look through my ain lads&#8217;
outgrown breeks and jackets. I&#8217;ll warrant wee
James will come to us next door to naked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didna know that you had saved the lads&#8217; auld
claes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think I wad throw them awa&#8217;? All
our lads grew quick, they ne&#8217;er wore out a suit,
and I put their wee breeks and coaties awa&#8217;. I
thought they might come in for their ain bairns, and
lo and behold! Allan&#8217;s little lad is, like as not, to
come into his feyther&#8217;s Sunday raiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you save their shirts and such like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t I? But vera few linen things are
left. They were too easy to wear and tear, to be
long-lived, but I fancy I can find a sleeping gown
for the bairn, and maybe a shirt or twa. But stockings
are beyond mention. They got them into unmendable
holes, and left them in the boats, or the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
fish sheds, and I fairly wore my knitting needles
awa&#8217; knitting for lads wha wouldna use their feet
ony way but skin-bare.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the grandmother went to find what clothes
she could for a little lad of eight years old, and
Christine sat down to answer Neil&#8217;s last letter.
To herself she called it an &#8220;overflowing screed.&#8221;
Indeed it was full of the great Reginald Rath, his
fine family, his comfortable wealth, his sister, Roberta,
and her highly respectable house in the
Monteith Row o&#8217;erby the Green of Glasgow City.
Christine told him in reply that she was glad he
had found a friend so conformable to all his wishes.
She asked him if he had heard lately from Angus
Ballister, and casually mentioned that the Domine
had received ten days ago a letter from the Colonel
about the school building, and that Angus had sent
her some bonnie pictures of the city of Rome. She
also informed him that his nephew was coming to
Culraine, and that she herself was going to take
the charge of him, and so might not have time
to write as often as she had done.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Faith came from the village to
help with the nets a-mending, and she brought the
village gossip with her, and among the news of all
kinds, the date of her own marriage. She was
going to wed the Largo man on Christmas Day, and
she had forgotten her loneliness and melancholy,
and laughed and joked pleasantly, as she went over
her plans with Christine. Margot watched her, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
listened to her with great interest, and when at
sunset the lassie went down the hill, she said to
Christine: &#8220;Wonders never cease. Faith Balcarry
was moping melancholy, she is now as merry as a
cricket. She was sick and going to die, she&#8217;s now
well and going to marry. She had nane to love her,
and nane she loved. Her whole talk now is o&#8217; the
Largo man, and the wonderfu&#8217; love he has for her,
and the untelling love she has for him. Weel!
Weel! I hae learned ane thing this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hae you learned, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae learned, that when a lass is dying wi&#8217; a
sair affliction, that there is parfect salvation in a
lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the evening of the third day ere James
Ruleson returned home. He had met no difficulties
with Mrs. Allan Ruleson that were not easily removed
by the gift of a sovereign. And he found
the little lad quietly but anxiously waiting for him.
&#8220;My feyther whispered to me that you would come,&#8221;
he said softly, as he snuggled into James&#8217; capacious
breast. &#8220;I was watching for you, I thought I could
hear your footsteps, after twelve o&#8217;clock today they
were coming nearer, and nearer&mdash;when you chappit
at the door, I knew it was you&mdash;Grandfeyther!&#8221;
And James held the child tighter and closer in his
arms, and softly stroked the white, thin face that
was pressed against his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tak&#8217; you hame to your grandmither,
and your aunt Christine,&#8221; James whispered to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
boy. &#8220;You are going to get well and strong, and
big, and learn how to read and write and play,
yoursel&#8217;, like ither bairns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon? How soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought God didna know about me. Such long,
long days and nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You puir little lad! God knew all the time. It
is o&#8217;er by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it come again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! Never again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day they left Glasgow about the noon
hour. The child had no clothing but an old suit of
his elder brother, and it was cold winter weather.
But James made no remark, until he had the boy
in the train for Edinburgh. Then he comforted
him with all the kind words he could say, and after
a good supper, they both went early to bed in a
small Edinburgh hostelry.</p>
<p>In the morning, soon after nine o&#8217;clock, James
took his grandson to a ready-made tailor&#8217;s shop,
and there he clothed him from head to feet in a
blue cloth suit. From the little white shirt to the
little blue cloth cap on his long fair hair, everything
was fit and good, and the child looked as if
he had been touched by a miracle. He was now
a beautiful boy, spiritually frail and fair, almost
angelic. Ruleson looked at him, then he looked
at the pile of ragged clothes that had fallen from his
little shrunken form, and he kicked them with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
big feet to the other end of the shop. A thick, warm
overcoat, and new shoes and stockings, were added
to the outfit, and then they were ready for their
home train.</p>
<p>As they walked slowly down Prina&#8217;s Street, they
met a regiment of Highland soldiers, accompanied
by a fine military band. The boy was enthralled,
he could not speak his delight, but he looked into
his grandfather&#8217;s face with eyes painfully eloquent.
It was evident that he had life to learn, not gradually,
as the usual infant learns it; but that its good
and evil would assail him through all his senses in
their full force. And Ruleson understood, partially,
how abnormally large and important very trivial
events might appear to him.</p>
<p>Soon after four o&#8217;clock they arrived at their destination,
and found a train omnibus about to go
their way. Ruleson lifted his grandson into it, and
the vehicle set them down at the foot of his own
hill; then he carried the boy up to the cottage in
his arms. The door was closed, but there was the
shining of fire and candlelight through the windows.
Yet their arrival was unnoticed, until Ruleson entered
and stood the little child in the middle of the
room. With a cry of welcome Margot and Christine
rose. Ruleson pointed to the child standing
in their midst. The next moment Christine was
removing his coat and cap, and when Margot turned
to him, his beauty and the pathos of his thin, white
face went straight to her heart. She took him in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
her arms and said, &#8220;Bonnie wee laddie, do ye ken
that I am your grandmither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, grandmither,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I ken. And
I hae a grandfeyther too. I am vera happy. Dinna
send me awa&#8217;, for ony sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the women set him in a big chair, and admired
and loved him from head to feet&mdash;his fair
hair, his wonderful eyes, his little hands so white
and thin&mdash;his wee feet in their neat, well-fitting
shoes&mdash;his dress so good and so becoming&mdash;this new
bairn of theirs was altogether an unusual one in
Culraine.</p>
<p>Ruleson quickly made himself comfortable in his
usual house dress. Christine began to set the table
for their evening meal, and Margot buttered the hot
scones and infused the tea. This meal had a certain
air of festivity about it, and the guest of honor
was the little child sitting at Ruleson&#8217;s right hand.</p>
<p>They had scarcely begun the meal, when there
was a knock at the door, and to Margot&#8217;s cheerful
&#8220;Come in, friend,&#8221; Dr. Trenabie entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessing on this house!&#8221; he said reverently, and
then he walked straight to the child, and looked
earnestly into his face. The boy looked steadily
back at him, and as he did so he smiled, and held
up his arms. Then the Domine stooped and kissed
him, and the thin, weak arms clasped him round
the neck.</p>
<p>It was a tender, silent moment. The man&#8217;s eyes
were misty with tears, and his voice had a new tone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
in it as he said, &#8220;Ruleson, this little lad is mine, as
well as yours. I have been spoken to. Through
him we shall all be greatly blessed, and we shall yet
see a grand preacher come out of the boats and the
fisherman&#8217;s cottage.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a few moments&#8217; silence, and then
Margot said, &#8220;Take your sitting, Sir, and a cup
o&#8217; tea will do you mair gude than doing without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit down gladly.&#8221; Then they talked of the
child&#8217;s extreme weakness and nervousness, and the
Domine said that with plenty of fresh milk, and
fresh fish, and with all the fresh air he could breathe,
and all the sleep he could shut his eyes for, the
little one would soon be well. &#8220;Then Christine,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;must give him his first lessons. After they
have been learned, it will be joy of Magnus Trenabie
to see him safe through school and college.
Give me so much interest in the boy, Ruleson, for he
is called and chosen, and we have in our hands the
making of a Man of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the evening, when the school affairs had
been discussed and the boy and Christine had disappeared,
the Domine was told the few sad incidents
which made up the whole life of little James
Ruleson. There was a strong tendency on his
grandfather&#8217;s part to make excuses for the mother
of the neglected boy. &#8220;You see, Domine,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;she has never been sick, and her ither children
are as rugged as hersel&#8217;. She couldna understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
James. She didna ken what to do wi&#8217; him, or for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Ruleson, but physical pride is as real
a sin as spiritual pride, and is the cause of much
suffering and unhappiness. My own father was one
of those bronze men, who thought weakness to be
cowardice, and sickness to be mostly imagination.
His children were all weak and sensitive, but he
insisted on our roughing it. Fagging and hazing
were good for us, he enjoyed them. Bodily strain
and mental cram were healthy hardening processes.
I had a little sister, she was weak and fearful, he
insisted on her taking the cold water cure. Nerves
were all nonsense! &#8216;Look at me!&#8217; he would say
proudly, &#8216;I get up early, I work all day, I know
nothing about headaches, or neuralgia, or nerves&#8217;&mdash;In
the world he passed for a genial, hearty man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hae plenty o&#8217; such unfeeling fellows,&#8221; said
Ruleson. &#8220;I dinna fret, when they hae a hard spell
o&#8217; rheumatism. Not I!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not mere flesh and blood, Ruleson, that
moves the earth on its axis. It is men whose intelligent
brows wear the constant plait of tension, whose
manner reveals a debility beneath which we know
that suffering lurks, and who have an unconscious
plaintiveness about them. Such men have fits of
languor, but let the occasion come and they command
their intellect and their hands just as easily
as a workman commands his tools. The mother
of this boy of ours was a physical tyrant in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
home, and she never suspected that she had under
her control and keeping a spirit touched and prepared
for the finest issues of life. Oh, Ruleson,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Sad it is to be weak,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And sadder to be wrong,</p>
<p>But if the strong God&#8217;s statutes break,</p>
<p class='indent2'>&#8217;Tis saddest to be strong.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The child became rapidly an integral part of
the household. No one thought of him as a transient
guest, no one wanted him in that light, and
he unconsciously made many changes. Margot often
spoke to Christine of them: &#8220;Were you noticing
your feyther this afternoon, Christine?&#8221; she asked
one day, when little James had been two weeks with
them. &#8220;Were you noticing him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How, Mither, or whatna for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, as soon as he was inside the house, the
laddie had his hand, and when he sat down he was
on his knee, and showing him the book, and saying
his letters to him&mdash;without missing ane o&#8217; them, and
granddad listening, and praising him, and telling
him it was wonderfu&#8217;, an&#8217; the like o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then, it is wonderfu&#8217;! He learns as if he
was supping new milk. He&#8217;ll be ready for the
school when the school is ready for him. And
he&#8217;s nae trouble in ony way. The house would be
gey dull wanting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s truth itsel&#8217;. I like to hear his soft footsteps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
and I would miss his crooning voice going
o&#8217;er his lessons. You mustna gie him too lang, or
too many lessons. I hae heard learning tasks were
bad for sickly weans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that was the cause o&#8217; his mither neglecting
him anent his books, and such things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not it! His mither is a lazy, unfeeling hizzy!
I&#8217;d like to hae the sorting o&#8217; her&mdash;fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was too sick to be bothered wi&#8217; books
and lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he wad niver hae been sick at a&#8217;, if he
had been gi&#8217;en a few books and lessons. Griselda
Ruleson had better keep out o&#8217; my presence. If she
ventures into it, the words arena to seek, that I&#8217;ll
gie her.&#8221;</p>
<p>One cold afternoon Christine was hearing the
boy&#8217;s lessons when Cluny Macpherson called. He
looked annoyed at the child&#8217;s presence and said, &#8220;I
saw your mither in the village, sae I thought I wad
hae a chance to speak a few words to you, wi&#8217; nane
by, but oursel&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needna mind wee James.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send him awa&#8217;. I want you, and nane but you.&#8221;</p>
<p>James was sent away, and then Christine said,
&#8220;You hae got your will, Cluny. Now what hae
you to say to me, that the little one couldna listen
to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know, Christine, when you will marry
me. I hae been waiting months for that word, and
I can wait nae langer. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; awa&#8217; tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Your waiting isna over, Cluny. Indeed no! I&#8217;m
not thinking o&#8217; marriage, nor o&#8217; anything like it.
I canna think o&#8217; it. Mither isna fit for any hard
wark, even the making o&#8217; a bed is mair than she
ought to do. I&#8217;m not thinking o&#8217; marriage. Not I!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time you were. Maist o&#8217; our girls marry
when they are nineteen years auld.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not nineteen yet. I don&#8217;t want to marry. I
hae my wark and my duty right here, i&#8217; this house&mdash;wark
that God has set me, and I&#8217;ll not desert it
for wark I set mysel&#8217;, to please mysel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way wi&#8217; women. They bring up God
and their duty to screen their neglect o&#8217; duty. Hae
ye nae duty towards me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you let a lad gie ye his life-lang love, and
feel nae duty anent it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ask you for your love. I hae told you,
mair than once, that I dinna want any man&#8217;s love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuts! That is out o&#8217; all nature and custom.
Ye be to marry some man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I havna seen the man yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking it will be Angus Ballister. I&#8217;ll
mak&#8217; him black and blue from head to foot, if he
comes near Culraine again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk foolishness. The Ballisters own twenty
houses or mair, in Culraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Houses! Twa rooms, a but and a ben, and a
heather roof. What are they bothering us the now
for? They hae let Culraine well alane for years&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
is only sin&#8217; you and your beauty cam&#8217; to the
forefront, that they hae remembered us. The factor,
to gather their rents, was a&#8217; we saw o&#8217; them,
till your brither brought that dandified lad here, and
then the auld man had to come&mdash;on the report o&#8217;
your beauty, nae doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a fishing net which required mending,
hanging against the wall, and Christine, standing
in front of it, went on weaving the broken meshes
together. She did not answer the jealous, impetuous
young man, and all at once he became conscious of
her silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak to me, Christine? Oh
lassie, canna you pity a lad sae miserable as I am,
and a&#8217; for the love I hae for you. I&#8217;m sorry! I&#8217;m
sorry! I&#8217;m broken-hearted, if I hae angered you!
My dear! My dear love! Will ye na speak ane word
to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turned to him a face full of pity and
anger, yet strangely beautiful. &#8220;Cluny,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you, if you&#8217;ll speak o&#8217; yoursel&#8217; and let
be a&#8217; ither folk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I? I&#8217;m sick wi&#8217; the fear that you love,
that you intend to marry Ballister. Tell me straight,
and be done wi&#8217; it, if that is what you intend to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You havna any right to ask me such a question.
I never gave you any right to do sae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hae let me love ye wi&#8217; a&#8217; my heart and soul
for fifteen years. Is that naething?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ithers hae loved me, as weel as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They hev not. Nane on this earth lo&#8217;es you as
I lo&#8217;e you. Nane!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was beyond himself in uttering these
words. It was a Cluny transfigured by a great love.
The loftier Inner Man spoke for his mortal brother,
and Christine looked at him and was astonished.
He appeared to be taller, he was wonderfully handsome,
his attitude of entreaty in some way ennobled
him, and his voice had a strange tone of winning
command in it, as he stretched out his arms and
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to me, Christine. I love you so! I love
you so! You cannot say me &#8216;nay&#8217; this afternoon.
It is perhaps the last time. My dearie, I am going
away tomorrow&mdash;it might be forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cluny! Cluny! You distress me! What do
you wish me to say, or do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the truth about Ballister. Are you
going to marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not this year&mdash;but next year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am never going to marry him in any year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you marry Cluny Macpherson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not unlikely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When? Be merciful, dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several things in the way o&#8217; my marrying
anyone just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, there&#8217;s that new bairn i&#8217; the house. Whatna
for is he here?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He is my brither Allan&#8217;s son. He is sick, we
are going to mak&#8217; him weel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, and you&#8217;ll wear a&#8217; your love on the little
brat, and send a man that lo&#8217;es you to death awa&#8217;
hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cluny, I love no man better than I love you.
Will not that satisfy you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na. It&#8217;s a mouthfu&#8217;, that&#8217;s a&#8217;. And it leaves
me hungrier than ever;&#8221; and he smiled and clasped
her hands so fondly, that she sat down beside him,
and let him draw her close to his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest woman on earth,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;when
will you be my ain? My very ain! My wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the right time comes, laddie. I love none
better than you. I&#8217;m not likely to love anyone better.
When the right time comes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you ca&#8217; the right time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I can marry without neglecting any duty
that God has left in my hands to perform, or look
after. I canna say mair. There are many things
to consider. Mither could not be left yet, and I
am not going to leave her for any man&mdash;and I hae
promised to tak&#8217; a&#8217; the care and charge o&#8217; Allan&#8217;s
little lad, but it&#8217;s Mither I am thinking mainly
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon will she be well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine, surely I hae trysted you this very hour.
Give me ane, just ane kiss, dearie. I&#8217;ll get through
years, if need be, wi&#8217; a kiss and a promise, and work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
will be easy to do, and siller be easy to save, if
Christine be at the end o&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he kissed her, and Christine did not deny
him, but when he took from his vest pocket a pretty
gold ring holding an emerald stone, she shook her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your birthstone, dearie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it
will guard you, and bring you luck, and, mind you
o&#8217; me beside. Tak&#8217; it, frae Cluny, do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, Cluny! I hae often heard my mither
say, &#8216;I hae plenty now, but the first thing I owned
was my wedding ring.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it would mind you o&#8217; Cluny, and the
promise ye hae just made him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I mak&#8217; a promise, Cluny, I&#8217;ll be requiring no
reminder o&#8217; the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you gie me a lock o&#8217; your bonnie brown
hair, to wear next my heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hae no charms made out o&#8217; my hair. Tak&#8217;
my word, just as I gave it. As far as I know, I&#8217;ll
stand by my word, when the right time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would just say a word anent the time. I
mean as to the probabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t, Cluny. I havna the ordering
o&#8217; events. You&#8217;ll be back and forth doubtless.
Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Mediterranean service, on ane o&#8217; the
Henderson boats. I&#8217;ll be making siller on thae
boats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna mak&#8217; it for me. It is you, your ain sel&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
I&#8217;ll marry, and I wouldna mind if we started wi&#8217; the
wedding ring, as Mither did. Folks may happen
live on love, but they canna live without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would hae chosen you, Christine, from out o&#8217;
a warld fu&#8217; o&#8217; women, but I like to think o&#8217; you as
mine by predestination, as well as choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didna think your Calvinism went that far,
Cluny. They&#8217;ll be haeing a kirk session on your
views, if you publicly say the like. Ye be to ta&#8217;
care o&#8217; the elders, laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>They could talk now cheerfully and hopefully,
and Cluny went away from Christine that night like
a new man, for</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>There is no pleasure like the pain</p>
<p>Of being loved, and loving.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then every day seemed to be happier than the
last. The child was sunshine in the house, whatever
the weather might be. His thin, soft voice,
his light step, above all, his shy little laugh, went
to their hearts like music. He had only learned
to laugh since he came to Culraine. Margot remembered
the first time she had heard him laugh.
She said he had been almost afraid, and that he
had looked inquiringly into her face, as if he had
done something he should not have done.</p>
<p>So the weeks and the months wore away, and
the winter came, but the weather was sunny and
not very cold, and in early December Ruleson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
wrapped his grandson up in one of his own pilot
coats, and took him to the boat, and carried him
to the fishing ground, and showed him how to cast
and draw the line. And Jamie took naturally to
the sea, and loved it, and won Ruleson&#8217;s heart over
again, whenever he begged to go with him.</p>
<p>Then Christmas and New Year were approaching,
and there were many other pleasures and interests.
Faith&#8217;s marriage was drawing near, and she was
frequently at Ruleson&#8217;s, for the girl relied on Christine&#8217;s
help and advice in all matters concerning the
new life to which she was going. This year also,
Christmas was made memorable by a box full of
gifts which came all the way from Rome, with the
compliments and good will of the Ballisters and
which contained many remembrances for the villagers.
For Ruleson himself there was a fine
barometer, to Margot a brooch and earrings of
white cameo, and to Christine some lovely lace, and
a set of scarlet coral combs, beads, and earrings.
To Christine&#8217;s care there was also intrusted a box
full of Roman ribbons, scarves, and neckties, their
wonderful hues making them specially welcome gifts
to people so fond of brilliant colors.</p>
<p>From these gay treasures a scarf and sash were
selected for the bride, and the rest were sent on
Christmas Eve to the young girls of the village.
Many other pretty trifles were among the gifts&mdash;fans
and sets of Roman pearls, and laces for the
neck and head, and pretty veils, and fancy handkerchiefs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
and in a long letter Angus directed Christine
to do her will with all he sent. He only wished
to repay to the village the happy hours he had spent
in it the past summer.</p>
<p>This letter was not lover-like, but it was friendly,
and sad. He said so much might have been, and
yet nothing he longed for had happened. He recalled
tender little episodes, and declared they were
the only memories he valued. The whole tone of
the letter was the tone of a disappointed and hopeless
man, to whom life had lost all its salt and savor.
Christine read it carefully. She was determined
not to deceive herself, and in a wakeful watch of
the night, she went over it, and understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isna ony truth in it,&#8221; she said to herself,
&#8220;and I needna gie a thought to the lad&#8217;s fine words.
He is writing anent a made-up sorrow. I&#8217;ll warrant
he is the gayest o&#8217; the gay, and that the memory
o&#8217; Christine is a little bit o&#8217; weariness to him. Weel,
he has gi&#8217;en what he could buy&mdash;that&#8217;s his way, and
he will mak&#8217; in his way a deal o&#8217; pleasure among
the young lasses.&#8221; And the next day the bits of brilliant
silk were sorted and assigned, and then sent
to the parties chosen, with the Ballister compliments.
The affair made quite a stir in the cottages, and
Angus would have been quite satisfied, if he could
have heard the many complimentary things that the
prettiest girls in Culraine said of him.</p>
<p>Two days before Christmas Day, Neil made his
family a short visit. He was looking very well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
was handsomely dressed, and had all the appearance
and air of a man thoroughly satisfied with himself
and his prospects. He only stayed a short afternoon,
for his friend Reginald was waiting for him
at the hotel, and he made a great deal of his friend
Reginald.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should hae brought him along wi&#8217; you,&#8221;
said Margot, and Neil looked at Christine and answered&mdash;&#8220;I
lost one friend, with bringing him here,
and I am not a man who requires two lessons on
any subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend had naething but kindness here,
Neil,&#8221; answered Christine, &#8220;and he isna o&#8217; your
opinion.&#8221; And then she told him of the Christmas
presents sent from Rome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly so! That is what I complain of. All
these gifts to you and the villagers, were really
taken from me. I have not been remembered. Last
Christmas I was first of all. A woman between two
men always makes loss and trouble. I ought to
have known that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Neil,&#8221; said Margot, &#8220;there&#8217;s other kindnesses
you can think o&#8217;er.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not had a single New Year&#8217;s gift this
year&mdash;yet. I suppose Reginald will not forget me.
I have my little offering to him ready;&#8221; and he took
a small box from his pocket, and showed them a
rather pretty pair of sleeve buttons. &#8220;Yes, they
are pretty,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;rather more than I
could afford, but Reginald will return the compliment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
I dare say it will be the only one I shall receive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought not to forget, Neil,&#8221; said Margot,
in a not very amiable tone, &#8220;you ought to remember,
that you had your New Year&#8217;s gifts at Midsummer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I never forget that! I could not, if I
would,&#8221; he answered with an air of injury, and
Christine to avert open disagreement, asked, &#8220;Where
will you stay in Glasgow, Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay with Reginald, at his sister&#8217;s house.
She lives in highly respectable style, at number
twelve, Monteith Row. The row is a fine row o&#8217;
stone houses, facing the famous Glasgow Green, and
the Clyde river. She is a great beauty, and I expect
to be the honored guest of the occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you hae time to hunt up your brithers in
Glasgow? Some o&#8217; them will nae doubt be in port,
and you might call at Allan&#8217;s house, and tell them
that little Jamie is doing fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not expect I shall have a moment to spare.
If I have, I will make inquiries. I think, however,
Miss Rath is going to make rather a gay time in my
honor, and I shall feel obligated to observe all its
occasions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is Miss Rath?&#8221; asked Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never asked her age. I suppose
she is over twenty, as she controls her own property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Happen you may lose your heart to her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&#8220;O! I am not a man to lose anything so important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, weel, you&#8217;re nae wiser than the lave o&#8217;
men, Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am, Christine. At least, I have that
reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you hae a cup o&#8217; tea, Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Christine who asked him, and he answered,
&#8220;No. I had just finished a good lunch, when I came
here, and Reginald said he should wait dinner for
me. He orders very liberally, I must say,&#8221; and he
took out a new gold watch, and looked at the time.</p>
<p>His mother saw it at once, and glanced at Christine,
who instantly followed an exclamation of wonder,
by asking, &#8220;Whoever gave ye the bonnie timepiece,
Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave it to myself, Christine. I have been
coaching Reginald, and two or three other students,
and it&#8217;s rather a paying business. I shall do a great
deal in that way after the New Year. Well, I think
I must be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your feyther will be hame within an hour. He&#8217;ll
hae our wonderfu&#8217; bairn wi&#8217; him. You will surely
stay and see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Allan&#8217;s son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; answered Christine, &#8220;he&#8217;s a beauty, and
he is sae clever, we&#8217;ll be needing a school, and the
set o&#8217; teachers in it, to keep the lad within the proper
scope o&#8217; knowledge. He&#8217;s a maist remarkable boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to fill that position,&#8221; said Neil.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not you,&#8221; said Margot. &#8220;You were a puir
weakling, every way. It took everyone&#8217;s love and
labor to bring you through. I&#8217;m not sure now, if
you were worth it. It was scrimp and toil through
long years for a&#8217; the Rulesons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not ungrateful, Mother, and I shall no
doubt win a high degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hae nae doubt you will, Neil. Dinna go as
soon as you come. Feyther will be here anon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot keep Reginald waiting. I will try and
see father as I return.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he went, and mother and sister looked at each
other, and were silent. Margot opened and shut
a drawer in the dresser, pushed the chair in which
Neil had sat violently into its place, and then lifted
a broom and flung it down with a force that is best
explained by the word &#8216;temper.&#8217; She felt unable
to speak, and finally burst into passionate weeping,
mingled with angry words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mither! Mither! dinna tak&#8217; on that way.
It&#8217;s nae new thing. It&#8217;s just what we expectit. You
hae looked it in the face many a time. Oh, I&#8217;m sae
glad his feyther wasna here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His feyther ought to hae been here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na! na! We dinna want feyther to think a&#8217;
his love and labor was thrown awa&#8217;. It wad fairly
break his heart. We must just keep the mistake to
oursel&#8217;s. We can forgie, and still lo&#8217;e the puir lad,
but feyther wad go to extremes, both wi&#8217; Neil and
himsel&#8217;. We can thole his selfishness. We aye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
knew it was there. We hae held our tongues sae
far. We must gae on being silent. I wouldna hae
feyther know for onything. Let him hae his dream,
Mither!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart feels like to break, lassie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine too, Mither. But we needna gie feyther
a heart-break. We&#8217;ll just keep the visit quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your way be it, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Women do such things!</i></p>
<p>At this moment Ruleson&#8217;s voice was heard. He
was coming up the hill with Jamie&#8217;s hand in his
own. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be inside in a minute, Mither&mdash;a
smile frae you is worth gold now,&#8221; and she stooped
and kissed her mother. This unusual token of love
and care went to Margot&#8217;s heart with a bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear lassie,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do as you say,&#8221;
and that moment she was called upon to make good
her words. Ruleson was at the hearthstone, and
Jamie was at her knees, telling her what a splendid
time they had had, and how many big fish they had
caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you bring ane o&#8217; the haddocks hame with
you, James?&#8221; she asked, and Ruleson answered, &#8220;I
found Tamsen&#8217;s boy at the pier, waiting to buy all
my catch, and I thought ye wad hae something better
for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s naething better than a fresh haddock.
You canna cook them wrang, if you try; but I&#8217;ll
find something good for good fishermen like you
and Jamie.&#8221; And she spread the table with good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
things, and Ruleson said softly, as if to himself&mdash;&#8220;Thou
satisfieth my mouth with good things, my
cup runneth over.&#8221; And Christine and her mother
had come very close to each other and Margot had
forgotten her heart-break in Christine&#8217;s kiss, and
almost forgotten Neil&#8217;s visit. At any rate she was
quite happy to hide it from her husband. &#8220;He&#8217;s
like a&#8217; men,&#8221; she reflected, &#8220;he doesna spit oot his
anger like I do, and be rid o&#8217; it. He buries it in his
heart, and he buries it alive, and it doesna gie him
a moment&#8217;s peace. Christine is right, and I&#8217;m glad
I held my tongue, even frae good words.&#8221;</p>
<p>When all the Ballister Christmas presents had
been distributed the New Year&#8217;s festival was at
hand, and the village was all agog about Faith&#8217;s
marriage. The arrangements had been slightly
changed, and after all she was to be married from
Ruleson&#8217;s house. Early in the morning she came
up there with her simple bride garments in a
leather trap, which she carried in her hand. She
wanted Christine to dress her. She said, Christine
had brought her all her good fortune, and she be
to send her away, and then good would go with
her.</p>
<p>So Christine dressed the timid little woman, and
really made her look lovely, and at ten o&#8217;clock her
Largo lover, called Willie Anderson, came there
also. He had a couple of friends with him, and
Ruleson himself took the place of Faith&#8217;s father,
and gave her his arm, as they all walked together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
very doucely and religiously, to the Domine&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>The Domine had been advised of the visit, and
the large Bible lay open on the table. Standing
before it the young couple received the Domine&#8217;s
charge, and then in the presence of their witnesses,
pledged themselves to life-long love and devotion.
The Domine entered the contract in his Kirk Book,
and the witnesses signed it. Then the simple ceremony
was over. The Domine blessed the bride,
and she turned with a blushing, happy face to her
husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ain! My wife!&#8221; he said, and gave her his
arm, and Christine with her father and Anderson&#8217;s
two friends followed. All were very silent. The
bride and bridegroom were too happy to talk, and
their friends understood and sympathized with the
feeling.</p>
<p>The day was fine and clear, and the walk back
to Ruleson&#8217;s was still and sweet, and in spite of
its silence, very pleasant; and they had no sooner
opened Ruleson&#8217;s door, than their senses were refreshed
by the sight of the festal table, and the
odor of delicious foods. For Margot had made
a wedding dinner after her own heart. One of her
precious turkeys had been sacrificed, and there was
that wealth of pudding and cakes and pastry which
no man loves and appreciates more than the fisherman.
It was an excellent dinner, well cooked, and
well enjoyed, and happily prolonged with pleasant
conversation, until Christine reminded them they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
were probably keeping the crowd asked to the
Fishers&#8217; Hall waiting.</p>
<p>In a pleasant haste they left all in James&#8217; care,
and went in a body to the hall. There was quite
a large company there, very well employed in practicing
the steps of a new strathspey, and others in
exhibiting their special bits of splendor. The whole
room was flashing with Roman colors, and Judith
Macpherson&#8217;s Protestantism was angered by it. She
said with her usual striking eloquence, that, in her
opinion, they were nothing but emblems of popery.
They came frae Rome. Why not? If we had
elders in the kirk, worth the name o&#8217; elders, they
wad ca&#8217; a session anent such a shamefu&#8217; exhibition
o&#8217; the pope&#8217;s vera signs and symbols. Indeed, she
told Ruleson that she would stand up in the kirk
on the next Sabbath day, if he, or someone, didna
tak&#8217; the proper steps in the matter, and &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,
James Ruleson, I&#8217;m minded to go my ways to the
manse right now, and bring the Domine himsel&#8217;
here, to see the wicked testimonies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the bridal dance began, and Ruleson drew
Judith aside, and told her he would himself speak
anent the colors, if she thought they were sinfu&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinfu&#8217;!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;Why Ruleson, man,
they come frae the pope, and thae men they ca&#8217;
socialists. I hae heard tell o&#8217; the tricolor, and of
a&#8217; the misery and sin that cam&#8217; frae it in France.
Isna France i&#8217; the pope&#8217;s dominions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, Judith, they arena the same countries.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;James Ruleson, they may be different countries,
but that tricolor sin is the same everywhere, even
if it get into a godly place like Culraine. You must
put a stop to our lasses wearing the pope&#8217;s colors,
James Ruleson. That&#8217;s a fact!&#8221;</p>
<p>James promised to do so. In reality he would
have promised anything she asked, rather than have
her go to the manse and disturb the Domine. He
was only too grateful to observe that the wearers
of the sinful colors were not disturbed by Judith&#8217;s
suspicions, and that the sailormen and fishermen
were apparently most in love with the girls
who wore the greatest quantity of the offensive emblems.</p>
<p>At three o&#8217;clock the dance was over, the greetings
were all said and Willie Anderson anxious to
carry off his bride on the tide top. &#8220;The waters
are fu&#8217; at four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said to Ruleson, <ins title='Added quote'>&#8220;and</ins> I
want to lift anchor and spread sails at the same
moment. Then we&#8217;ll hae wind and tide wi&#8217; us, and
we&#8217;ll win hame on the tide top. That would be a
lucky thing, you ken, Ruleson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ways o&#8217; a good man are a&#8217; lucky, Anderson,
for they are ordered of the Lord, but a man must
hae his way on his wedding day&mdash;maybe he&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er
get it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Ruleson said a few words to the chattering
groups, and they instantly formed into line. The
violins went first, then the bride and bridegroom.
Then Ruleson and Margot, Christine and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
brother Norman, and the rest as fancy led them in
the selection of partners.</p>
<p>Willie Anderson&#8217;s brand-new boat lay at the pier,
and he had rigged up a little gangway trimmed with
ivy between it and the shore. Every boat in harbor
was flying its flag, except Anderson&#8217;s boat&mdash;she was
waiting for the bride, but as soon as the crowd had
settled itself, Anderson went to the gangway, and
a little lad waiting there for that purpose handed
him a parcel. It contained the new flag for the new
boat, and it was blue as the sea, and had three white
words in its center, &#8220;Mine and Thine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while cheering filled the air, Willie wrapped
it round his bride&#8217;s slim form, and then lifting her
in his strong arms, he leaped into the boat with
her. In a few minutes the flag was flying at the
masthead, the anchor lifted, and the <i>Mine and Thine</i>
began her home journeying.</p>
<p>And as they watched her, the tide turned, the
sails filled, and she danced out of harbor, for the
tide ran with her, and she was timed to reach home
on the tide top.</p>

</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Neil</span> did not find it convenient on his return
northward, to call again at the home in Culraine.
His mother was disappointed, and
fretted to Christine about the neglect. His father
was silent, but James Ruleson&#8217;s silence often said
far more than words. When all hope of a call
was over, Christine wrote to her brother, telling
him in plain words what desire and hope and disappointment
had filled the two days previous to
the re-commencement of the Maraschal classes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neil, dear lad, you must know that Mither was watching
the road up the hill, for the past two or three days, and for
the same time feyther didna go near the boats. He was
watching the road likewise, for he didna want to miss you
again. They were, both o&#8217; them, sairly disappointed, when
you neither came, nor sent word as to what was keeping you
from sae evident a duty. Ye be to remember that Mither
isna as well as she should be; and you must not neglect her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
now, Neil. You might ne&#8217;er be able to make it up to her
in the future, if you do. I&#8217;m telling you, dear lad, for your
ain heart&#8217;s ease. Yesterday morning, she put on a clean cap
and apron and sat down by the fireside to knit, and watch
and listen. By and by, the cat began to wash her face, and
Mither was weel pleased wi&#8217; the circumstance, for she said
it was a sure sign company was coming. So she went often
to the door, and watched and listened, but no company
came, till sun down, when the Domine called. Mither was
so disappointed she couldna steady her voice, her eyes were
full o&#8217; angry tears, and she drove poor old Sandy off the
hearth, and into the cold, calling him a &#8220;lying prophet,&#8221; and
ither hard names, to which Sandy is not accustomed. Forbye,
she hasna gi&#8217;en him a drop o&#8217; milk since. Do write Mither
a long letter, full o&#8217; love and hope o&#8217; better days, and make
some good excuses to her, for your neglect. Christine can
make them out o&#8217; her ain loving heart.</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Christine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Christine in this letter did small justice
to Margot&#8217;s indignant disappointment, and now that
hope was over, she made no pretense of hiding her
wrong and her sorrow. The Domine saw as soon
as he entered the cottage, that Margot was in great
trouble, and he more than guessed the reason, for
he had been called to the town very early in the day,
to meet an old friend on his way to the Maraschal
College, where he filled a Professor&#8217;s Chair in the
medical department. Passing with this friend down
the High Street, he had seen Neil with Roberta
Rath on his arm, examining leisurely the attractive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
shop windows, while Reginald trailed at speaking
distance behind them.</p>
<p>He kept still further behind. He had no desire
to interfere. Neil had never sought his confidence,
and he did not know&mdash;except through Christine&#8217;s
partial remarks&mdash;what the young man&#8217;s private
hopes and plans might be. So he listened to Margot&#8217;s
passionate complaints a little coldly, and she
was quick to perceive it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You canna understand, Domine, what I suffer.
Ye hae never had an ungratefu&#8217; bairn. And I&#8217;m
feeling for his feyther too&mdash;the dear auld man, he&#8217;ll
be clean heart-broken!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Margot! A good heart that trusts in
God, never breaks. It has no cause to break.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is eleven years, Domine, we hae all o&#8217; us been
keepin&#8217; oursel&#8217;s poor, for Neil&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last eleven years, Margot, you have
missed no good thing. God has been good to you,
and to yours. I have seen! I have not forgotten!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few kind words would hae paid for a&#8217;
we hae pinched and wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been neither pinch nor want in your
home, Margot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t ken a&#8217; things, Sir. My man has worked
harder than he ought to hae worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you may be mistaken, Margot. James
Ruleson trusts in God. Why should he overwork
himself?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To keep the roof o&#8217;er our heads, and find food
for the bairns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, Margot! Prayer, and lawful work,
keep the door safe, and the table spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Domine! If you feel that your love is
slighted&mdash;that the bairn you love mair than yoursel&#8217;
lightlies ye; if you feel that he&#8217;s &#8217;shamed o&#8217;
you!&#8221; And Margot covered her face, and her
words were lost in heart-breaking sobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margot, you must cease weeping. Will it do
you any good to kill yourself? What will you say
to your Maker in such case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I willna be feared to say all that is in my heart
to Him. He knows a mither&#8217;s heart, and the griefs
it tholes and carries. I canna expect you to know
how love feels when it is scorned, and made little o&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know something of that same sorrow, Margot.
I gave the love of my life to one who scorned
it. Only God knew my sorrow, but He was sufficient
for my comfort. There is only one way of
conquering wrongs against love, Margot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot did not speak, and after a moment&#8217;s
pause, he asked, &#8220;Do you want to know that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Sir. If it is your way, I&#8217;m no able to follow
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you try. You think your youngest son
has treated you badly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;m sure o&#8217; it, and he&#8217;s treated his feyther
and his brothers badly, and his one sister worse than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
a&#8217;. How can folk forget injuries that tread love
under feet? They canna do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can. Do you want to know how? Do
you want to know how I did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldna walk in your shoon, Sir. They&#8217;re o&#8217;er
big for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Mither, Sir. Tell her, she&#8217;ll maybe find
it easier than she thinks; and maybe I could help
her;&#8221; and Christine went and stood by her mother&#8217;s
chair, and drew her mother&#8217;s head close to her
breast, and kissed her softly, as she whispered,
&#8220;Ask the Domine what to do wi&#8217; wrangs ye canna
bear, and canna pay back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the sair part, Sir. Christine has touched
the raw. If any man or woman in the village scorns
or wrangs me, I can gie them as gude as they send&mdash;words
or blows&mdash;and I wad do it! Yes, I would!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you given up your kirk membership, Margot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Sir, I hae done naething yet, requiring me to
do sae; but it&#8217;s hard saying what I might be driven
to, if somebody doesna mak&#8217; Jess Morrison quit meddling
wi&#8217; my family affairs&mdash;the lying hizzy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margot! Margot! My friend Margot! You
astonish me, you trouble me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Domine, I&#8217;m very sorry to trouble you.
I wad rather trouble the hale village than you.
What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to try for one month, my plan of treating
any injustice, or injury, I receive.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Weel then, what is your plan? I&#8217;m no promising
to do what I&#8217;m vera sure is far oot o&#8217; my way,
but if you had been injured on every side o&#8217; your
heart, as I hae been, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I receive an injury, Margot, I think it
calmly over, and I am sure to find some excuse for
part of it&mdash;the rest I forgive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nae excuse in Neil&#8217;s case, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are several. These Rath&#8217;s promise
much for his future. He may even be in love with
Miss Rath, and a man in love isna a responsible
creature. You hae told me, in the course of years,
how much Norman&#8217;s wife troubled you, and Norman
could not prevent her. I have heard the same
kind of story about Robert&#8217;s and Allan&#8217;s, and Alexander&#8217;s
wives. Men do not seem to be responsible,
when they are seeking some woman for a wife. Take
this into your thoughts, anent Neil. There were
also unhappy money considerations. Evidently Neil
is not ready to pay Christine&#8217;s ninety pounds back,
and he does not like to be questioned about it. He
would rather keep out of the way. In both these
cases, it is not Neil. It is first the girl, then the
money. He does not despise you, he is only too
considerate about Miss Rath. In the case of the
money, he is perhaps counting on its use for his
advancement in life, and he would rather not talk
about it. He does not hate or scorn his own people,
he is only looking out for his future love, and his
future living. That is such a common and natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
feeling, we need not wonder and weep over it.
There must be other excuses to make, if I knew
all about Neil&#8217;s life and hopes, and for the rest of
the faults against him&mdash;forgive them, as God forgives
your faults against His long suffering love and
patience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe that is the right way, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right! Say that word to yourself, Margot. Say
it till it rings like a shout in your soul, till you feel
it in your hand like a drawn sword. It is a conquering
word. Say it till your weak heart grows
strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither will feel better in a few days, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure she will. Neither joy nor sorrow
leaves us where it found us. Poor Neil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why &#8216;poor Neil,&#8217; Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he cannot see beyond his limit, and his
limit is self, and selfishness is utter loss. They conquer
who endure. Live it down. Deserting our
own is a cruel, silent treason even if they deserve it.
It is a sin that our souls are ashamed of. Margot,
your weakness tonight came o&#8217;er you in a moment
when you were slack in Faith. You are naturally
and spiritually a brave woman, Margot. What
have you to fear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna want the lad I hae nursed at my breast
to be ashamed o&#8217; me&mdash;that is my fear, Domine. I
dinna want to lose his love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does a man ever forget the mother who bore
him? I can&#8217;t believe it. When all other loves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
fade, that is green. It is nearly fifty years since
I bid my mother &#8216;good-by&#8217; for ever in this life. She
is the dearest and sweetest mother to me yet. I remember
her eyes, the touch of her lips, the soft
caress of her hands, as if I had seen her yesterday.
A man, however wicked, is not beyond hope, who
yet loves his mother. Neil is not a bad boy. He
will love you to the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear, I fear, Domine, that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! You do not fear. You have nothing to
fear. There was a noted preacher and poet, who
shall tell you what your fear is. His name was
Crashaw, and he was an Englishman, who died just
about two hundred years ago and he says to a
fearful soul:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;There is no storm but this</p>
<p>Of your own cowardice,</p>
<p class='indent2'>That braves you out.</p>
<p>You are the storm that mocks</p>
<p>Yourself, you are the rocks</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of your own doubt.</p>
<p>Besides this fear of danger, there&#8217;s</p>
<p class='indent2'>No danger here,</p>
<p>And they that here fear danger,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Do deserve their fear.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay, that&#8217;s what you ca&#8217; poetry. I dinna understand
a word o&#8217; it, but I can mind that David said,
he didna fear, even in the dead-mirk-dale; but it&#8217;s a
far-back thought to King David, and when a mither
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
is angry at her bairn, she feels as if the Lord, too,
was like to lose sight o&#8217; her, and that earth and
heaven are baith a&#8217; wrang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Margot, when you feel as if the Lord
was like to lose sight o&#8217; you, then you canna lose
sight o&#8217; the Lord. Then, in the words of your
Covenanters&#8217; Psalms, you be to cry out: &#8216;How lang,
O Lord! Will ye mind me nae mair? How long
will ye hap yer face frae me?&#8217; And then, Margot,
you mind how the few verses of doubt and fear,
end&mdash;&#8216;the Lord he&#8217;s wrought a&#8217; things neiborlie for
me&#8217;. Now, Margot, I am not going to preach to
you. Your own leal heart can do that. I will just
say goodnight with one verse from that same dear
old book o&#8217; psalms&mdash;&#8216;Let the words o&#8217; my mouth,
an&#8217; the thought o&#8217; my heart, be for pleasure in yer
sight, O Lord, my strength, and my hame bringer.&#8217;
I leave blessing with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You werna as kind as you should hae been to
the Domine, Mither. He tried to comfort you,&#8221;
said Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was in the way o&#8217; his duty. What does
he know, puir fellow! anent a mither&#8217;s love or
sorrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad feyther hes wee Jamie for his comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but Jamie doesna comfort me, in the place
o&#8217; Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hae me, Mither. Dinna forget Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I do that? Never! Christine is worth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
a&#8217; the lads in Scotland. They marry&mdash;and forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine says he loves his mother today,
better than ever, and her dead near fifty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine is a wonder, and he ne&#8217;er put a
wife in her place. I hope your feyther didna go
to the toun today. Where has Jamie been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went out with feyther, this morning. I think
they went to the boats, but I canna weel say. They
ought to be hame by this hour. I wonder what is
keeping them sae late?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Christine, the trouble hes gone by, this
time, and we willna ca&#8217; it back. If your feyther
didna come across the lad i&#8217; the town, it will mebbe
be best to let him get back to the Maraschal without
remark or recollection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s keeping your feyther? It is
too late, and too cold, for Jamie to be out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear their voices, Mither. They&#8217;re coming
up the hill. Stir the fire into a blaze o&#8217; welcome.
Just listen to the laddie laughing&mdash;and feyther laughing
too. Whatever has happened to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>James Ruleson and the lad at his side came into
the cottage the next moment. The light of the
laugh was yet on their faces, and oh, what a happy
stir their advent made in the cozy, firelit room!
Margot forgot she had been crying and complaining,
she was helping her man take off his heavy coat,
and Christine was helping the child, who was in a
state of great excitement:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hae been to the circus!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Christine!
Gran&#8217;mither! I hae been to the circus! It was
wonderful! I did not want to leave it. I wanted
to stay always there. I want to go tomorrow.
Gran&#8217;feyther! Will you take me tomorrow? Say
yes! Do say yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, James!&#8221; cried Margot, &#8220;I never heard
tell o&#8217; the like! Hae ye lost your senses, gudeman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think I hae just found them. I am sair-hearted,
because I didna send all the lads there.
Let us hae a cup o&#8217; tea, and we will tell you how
we spent the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was a ten minutes hurry, and at the
end a well spread table, and four happy faces round
it; and as Margot handed Ruleson his big tea cup,
she said, &#8220;Now, James Ruleson, tell us what you
and the lad hae been after today, that took you
into such a sinfu&#8217; place as a circus. You&#8217;ll hae to
face the Domine on the matter. You, a ruling elder,
in a circus! I&#8217;m mair than astonished! I&#8217;m fairly
shocked at ye! And I&#8217;m feared it was a premeditated
sin. And ye ken what the Domine thinks o&#8217;
premeditated sins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was far from a sin o&#8217; any kind, gudewife.
Jamie and I were on our way to the boat, for a
few hours&#8217; fishing, when we met a lad wi&#8217; a note
from Finlay, saying he wanted a few words o&#8217;
advice from me, and I took a sudden thought o&#8217; a
day&#8217;s rest, and a bit o&#8217; pleasure wi&#8217; little Jamie.
Sae, to the town we went, and first o&#8217; all to Finlay&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
and I had a long talk wi&#8217; him, about some railway
shares he owns, on my advice; and they hae turned
out sae weel, he wanted me to tak&#8217; part o&#8217; the profit.
I wouldna do that, but I let him gie twenty pounds
towards the school fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might hae put that twenty in your ain pouch,
gudeman, and nae fault in the same. You are too
liberal anent the school. Our ain lads get naething
from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamie will hae the gude o&#8217; it, and lots o&#8217; Culraine
lads and lasses until they get a better one.
Weel, so be it! After Finlay and I had finished
our crack, I took Jamie to Molly Stark&#8217;s, and we
had a holiday dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chicken pie! Custard pudding! Strawberry tarts!
Nuts and raisins! And a big orange!
Grandmither! Oh, it was beautiful! Beautiful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we walked about the town a bit, and I saw
a big tent, and men playing music before it, and
when we got close pictures of animals and of horses,
and men riding. And Jamie saw many little lads
going in, especially one big school, and he said,
&#8216;Grandfeyther, tak&#8217; me in too!&#8217; And I took counsel
wi&#8217; my ain heart for a minute, and it said to me,
&#8216;Tak&#8217; the lad in,&#8217; and so I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now you&#8217;re blaming yoursel&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not. I think I did right. There was
neither sound nor sight o&#8217; wrang, and the little laddie
went wild wi&#8217; pleasure; and to tell the vera truth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
I was pleased mysel&#8217; beyond a&#8217; my thoughts and
expectations. I would like to tak&#8217; you, Margot, and
Christine too. I would like it weel. Let us a&#8217; go
the morn&#8217;s night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae not lost my senses yet, James. Me go to
a circus! Culraine wad ne&#8217;er get o&#8217;er the fact. It
wad be a standing libel against Margot Ruleson.
As for Christine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wad like weel to go wi&#8217; Feyther.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fairly astonished at you, Christine! Lassie,
the women here would ne&#8217;er see you again, they wad
feel sae far above ye. I&#8217;m not the keeper o&#8217; your
feyther&#8217;s gude name, but I hae a charge o&#8217;er yours,
and it is clear and clean impossible, for you to go
to a circus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Feyther goes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your feyther hasna heard the last o&#8217; his spree
yet. To think o&#8217; him leaving the narrow road.
Him, near saxty years old! The kirk session on
the matter will be a notable one. Elders through
the length and breadth o&#8217; Scotland will be takin&#8217;
sides. Dear me, James Ruleson, that you, in your
auld age, should come to this!&#8221; and then Margot
laughed merrily and her husband and Christine understood
she was only joking.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll maybe go wi&#8217; us all some afternoon,
Margot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, James! I&#8217;ll not gie Jess Morrison, and
the like o&#8217; her, any occasion for their ill tongues.
They&#8217;d just glory in Margot Ruleson, Elder Ruleson&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
wife, going to the circus. I wouldn&#8217;t be
against going mysel&#8217; I&#8217;d like to go, but I wouldn&#8217;t
gie them the pleasure o&#8217; tossing my gude name on
their ill-natured tongues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Peter Brodie there, and his three lads,
and his daughter Bella.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, James, tak&#8217; the little laddie again, if so
you wish. Peter will stand wi&#8217; you, and he&#8217;s the
real ruling elder. But Christine is different. It
lets a woman down to be talked about, whether she
is right, or wrang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jamie was allowed to give his version of
the wonder and the joy of a circus, and the last cups
of tea were turned into some glorious kind of a
drink, by the laughter and delight his descriptions
evoked. Then and there it was resolved that his
grandfather must take him again on the following
day, and with this joyous expectation in his heart,
the child at last fell asleep.</p>
<p>When Ruleson and his wife were alone, Margot
noticed that her man&#8217;s face became very somber
and thoughtful. He was taking his bed-time smoke
by the fireside, and she waited beside him, with her
knitting in her hands, though she frequently dropped
it. She was sure he had something on his mind,
and she waited patiently for its revealing. At
length he shook the ashes from his pipe, and stood
it in its proper corner of the hob, then going to the
window, he looked out and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fair and calm, thank God! Margot, I saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Neil today.&#8221; As he spoke, he sat down, and looked
at her, almost sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say for himsel&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didna speak to him. I was in Finlay&#8217;s store,
at the back o&#8217; it, whar Finlay hes his office. A young
man came into the store, and Finlay got up and
went to speak to him. It was Rath, and when he
went awa&#8217;, Finlay called me, and showed me a little
group on the sidewalk. They were Rath and his
sister, our Neil and Provost Blackie&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Provost Blackie&#8217;s son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sae. And Neil and him were as well met
and friendly as if they had been brought up in
the same cottage. The four o&#8217; them stood talking
a few minutes, and then Neil offered his arm to
Miss Rath, and led the young lady to a carriage
waiting for them. She smiled and said something,
and Neil turned and bowed to Rath and young
Blackie, and then stepped into the carriage and took
his seat beside the lady, and they drove off together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gudeman, you arena leeing to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am telling you the plain evendown truth, Margot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I keepit oot o&#8217; his way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatna for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I needna say the words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say them for you&mdash;you thought he would
be ashamed o&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay, he might hae been. Dinna cry, woman.
Dear, dear woman, dinna cry! It&#8217;s our ain fault&mdash;our
ain fault. If we had stood firm for the pulpit,
if we had said, &#8216;you must be either a preacher
or a schoolmaster,&#8217; this wouldna hae been. We
were bent on makin&#8217; a gentleman o&#8217; him, and now
he prefers gentlemen to fishermen&mdash;we ought to
hae expectit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is cruel, shamefu&#8217;, ungratefu&#8217; as it can be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but the lad is only seeking his ain good.
If he still foregathered wi&#8217; our rough fisher-lads,
we wouldn&#8217;t like it. And we would tell him sae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might hae found time to rin down, and see
us for an hour or twa, and gie us the reasons for
this, and that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looked like he was courting the young lady&mdash;and
we know of auld times, wife, that when our
lads began courting, we hed to come after. I was
wrang to gie in to his studying the law. Studying
the gospels, he wad hae learned that there are
neither rich nor poor, in God&#8217;s sight. We gave the
lad to God, and then we took him awa&#8217; frae God,
and would mak&#8217; a lawyer and a gentleman o&#8217; him.
Weel, as far as I can see, he is going to be a&#8217; we
intended. We are getting what we hae worked for.
There&#8217;s nane to blame but oursel&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>This reasoning quite silenced Margot. She considered
it constantly, and finally came to her husband&#8217;s
opinion. Then she would not talk about
Neil, either one way, or the other, and it soon fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
out that the lad&#8217;s name was never mentioned in
the home where he had once ruled almost despotically.
Only Christine kept her faith in Neil. She
wrote him long letters constantly. She told him all
that was going on in the village, all about his father
and mother, the Domine and the school house. She
recalled pleasant little incidents of the past, and
prefigured a future when she would see him every
day. And she seldom named little Jamie. She
divined that Neil was jealous of the position the
child had gained in the household. And Christine
was no trouble-maker. Her letters were all messages
of peace and good will, and without any advice
from her father she had personally come to
very much the same conclusion that he had arrived
at. &#8220;There has been a great mistake,&#8221; she said
softly to herself, &#8220;and we be to mak&#8217; the best o&#8217; it.
It isna beyond God&#8217;s power to sort it right yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Neil was seldom named unless a letter came
from him, which was not a frequent occurrence. The
boxes filled with home delicacies were no longer
sent, nor was their absence noted, nor their presence
requested. Neil was making money as a coach to
younger and wealthier students. He now dined at
the best hotel, and had a very good breakfast in
his comfortable rooms. But Christine felt that
the breaking of this tie of &#8220;something good to eat&#8221;
was a serious thing. Home was a long way further
off to Neil, when the motherly baskets of homemade
dainties ceased coming to him, and all Christine&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
apologies&mdash;whether they touched his mother&#8217;s
ill health, or his own prosperity&#8217;s making them unnecessary,
did not mend the matter. They were
just common bread and meat, mere physical things,
but their want was heart-hunger, and doubt and suspicion,
in place of the love and pleasure they had
always caused.</p>
<p>Generally, however, as one interest in life dies
out, another springs up, and the school building,
and the little laddie kept the Ruleson family happily
busy. Ruleson had been asked to superintend
the building and he did the work with a completeness
which was natural to him. He looked over
every load of stone, and saw that the blocks of
granite were well fitting, and perfect in color. He
examined all the mortar made, lest the builders
follow modern habits and put too much sand among
the lime. He returned as unworthy many pounds of
nails, which were either too short, or too slight,
for the purposes for which they were intended; and
the slating for the roof was a thing he did not
trust to anyone but James Ruleson. So the school
house and his fishing kept him busy and happy, and
Margot and Christine looked at him with wonder
and pleasure. He was always smiling, and always
listening to Jamie, who was chattering at his side,
whenever he was on land.</p>
<p>So life at Culraine pursued the even tenor of its
way, until the middle of March, when the school
was opened for a short quarter until the herring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
should come on in July. The building was by no
means finished, but the walls were up, the windows
in, the slate roof on, and the desks and forms in
place. The master&#8217;s room, the painting, plastering,
and decoration were untouched. Ruleson thought
they could be attended to during the herring fishing,
and the school formally opened in September.</p>
<p>To a man quite unaccustomed to business, these
were tremendous, yet delightful responsibilities; and
Ruleson lived between his boat and the school.
When he was on land, Jamie was always at his side.
Hitherto Ruleson had been noted for his reticence.
Even among such a silent race as the Fife fishers
his silence was remarkable. He had held his peace
even from good, but the child always chattering at
his side had taught him to talk. Jamie&#8217;s thirst for
knowledge was insatiable, he was always wanting to
know something or other, and the inquisitive &#8220;why&#8221;
was constantly on his lips. Few people could remember
James Ruleson&#8217;s laughing, now his big guffaw
constantly carried on its echo the little lad&#8217;s
shrill treble laugh. Ruleson had many amiable qualities
unused and undeveloped that the boy brought
out in many different ways. In his little grandson&#8217;s
company he was born again, and became as a little
child. This was an actual and visible conversion.
The whole village testified to this wonderful new
birth.</p>
<p>On the fourteenth of March the dream of his
heart came true. He saw the little children come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
running through the sand hills, and over the heather,
to the school. From far and near, they came, wearing
their best clothes, and happy as if it was a holiday.
He listened to them reciting, after their teachers,
a morning prayer. He heard them learning in
class together the alphabet, and the first lessons in
numbers and addition, a lesson which all acquired
rapidly by some secret natural process. For if the
teacher asked how many two and two made, he had
not to wait a moment for a correct answer from
every baby mouth. It amazed Ruleson, until he remembered
that no one had ever taught him to count.
Through generations of clever bargaining mothers,
had this ability become a natural instinct. The
Domine thought it might have done so.</p>
<p>In some way or other, the school made Christine&#8217;s
life very busy. She was helping weary mothers
make little dresses, and little breeches, or doing a
bit of cleaning for them, or perhaps cooking a meal,
or nursing the baby for an hour. She was mending
or weaving nets, she was redding up her own home.
She was busy with the washing or ironing, or hearing
Jamie&#8217;s lessons, or helping her mother with the
cooking. Her hands were never idle, and there was
generally a smile on her face, a song on her lips, or
a pleasant word for everyone within the sound of
her cheerful voice.</p>
<p>She had also her own peculiar duties. There were
long and frequent letters from Cluny to answer, and
occasionally one from Angus Ballister, the latter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
always enclosing a pretty piece of lace, or a trifle
of some kind, special to the city he was in. Ballister&#8217;s
letters troubled her, for they were written
still in that tone of &#8220;it might have been,&#8221; with a certain
faint sense of reproach, as if it was her fault,
that it had not been. This was so cleverly insinuated,
that there was nothing for her to deny, or to
complain of. She wished he would not write, she
wished he would cease sending her any reminders
of &#8220;days forever gone.&#8221; His sentimental letters
were so evidently the outcome of a cultivated heart-breaking
disappointment, that they deeply offended
her sense of truth and sincerity.</p>
<p>One day she received from him a letter dated
Madrid, and it contained a handsome lace collar,
which she was asked to wear for his sake, and thus
remember his love &#8220;so sorrowfully passionate, and
alas, so early doomed to disappointment and
despair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The leeing lad!&#8221; she angrily exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
just tell him the truth, and be done wi&#8217; him. I&#8217;ll
send him the collar back, and tell him I&#8217;m no carin&#8217;
to be reminded o&#8217; him, in ony shape or fashion. I&#8217;ll
tell him he kens naething about love, and is parfectly
ignorant o&#8217; any honest way o&#8217; makin&#8217; love.
I&#8217;ll tell him that he never loved me, and that I never
loved him worth talking about, and that I&#8217;ll be obligated
to him if he&#8217;ll drop the makin&#8217; believe, and
write to me anent village matters, or not write at
a&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>Days so full and so happy went quickly away, and
though there had been so much to do, never had the
village been ready for the herring visit, as early,
and so completely, as it was this summer. When
Margot&#8217;s roses began to bloom, the nets were all
leaded, and ready for the boats, and the boats themselves
had all been overhauled and their cordage
and sails put in perfect condition. There would be
a few halcyon days of waiting and watching, but the
men were gathering strength for the gigantic labor
before them, as they lounged on the pier, and talked
sleepily of their hopes and plans.</p>
<p>It was in this restful interval that James and Margot
Ruleson received a letter from their son Neil,
inviting them to the great Commencement of his
college. He said he was chosen to make the valedictory
speech for his class, that he had passed his
examination with honor, and would receive his commission
as one of Her Majesty&#8217;s attorneys at law.
&#8220;If you would honor and please me by your presence,
dear father and mother,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;I shall
be made very happy, and I will secure a room for
you in the house where I am living, and we can have
our meals together.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is needless to say this letter canceled all faults.
Margot was delighted at the prospect of a railway
journey, and a visit to Aberdeen. She was going to
see for hersel&#8217; what a university was like&mdash;to see
the hundreds o&#8217; lads studying for the law and the
gospel there&mdash;to hae a change in the weary sameness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
of her hard fisher life. For a few days she was
going to be happy and play, hersel&#8217;, and see her
lad made a gentleman, by the gracious permission o&#8217;
Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>The invitation being gladly accepted, Margot had
anxious consultations with Christine about her dress.
She knew that she was the handsomest woman in
Culraine, when she wore her best fishing costume;
&#8220;but I canna wear the like o&#8217; it,&#8221; she said in a lingering,
rather longing tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, Mither, ye be to dress yoursel&#8217; like a&#8217;
ither ladies. Your gray silk is fine and fitting, but
you must hae a new bonnet, and white gloves, and
a pair o&#8217; patent leather shoon&mdash;a low shoe, wi&#8217; bows
o&#8217; black ribbon on the instep. There&#8217;s few women
hae a neater foot than you hae, and we&#8217;ll gae the
morn and get a&#8217; things needfu&#8217; for your appearance.
Feyther hes his kirk suit, and he is requiring naething,
if it be not a pair o&#8217; gloves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never puts a glove on his hand, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, weel, he can carry them in his hand. They
are as respectable in his hands, as on them. It is
just to show folk that he can afford to glove his
hands, if he wants to do it. That is maistly what
people wear fine claes of all kinds for. They would
be happier i&#8217; their ivery day loose and easy suits,
I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221; said Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why Neil didna ask you, Christine.
You helped him many a weary hour to the place he
is now standing on. If he had not asked anyone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
else, he ought to hae bidden you to his finishing and
honoring. Why didn&#8217;t he do that proper thing?
Hae ye ony quarrel wi&#8217; him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word oot o&#8217; place between us. I wrote him
a four-page letter three days syne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s feared for me, Mither. He&#8217;s feared his
friend Reginald will do as Angus did, fa&#8217; in love
wi&#8217; me, and then get oot o&#8217; love wi&#8217; him. Men are
silly as bairns anent some things. I&#8217;m not carin&#8217;,
Mither. Someone must bide at hame, and look after
wee Jamie, and you yoursel&#8217; will be mair contented
if you ken I am here to tak&#8217; tent o&#8217; the house and
bairn, and the lave o&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, it&#8217;s better. You canna leave a house its
lane, any mair than a bairn. The ane will get into
dole and mischief, as quick as the ither. You&#8217;ll be
minding Polly Cromarty&#8217;s bit cottage, taking fire
and burning to the ground, and not a man, woman,
or bairn near it. And Bella Simpson the same, and
Kate Dalrymple losing a&#8217; her savings, and the house
locked and barr&#8217;d and naebody in it, or near it. I&#8217;ll
go to Aberdeen real happy if you are watching the
house, while I&#8217;m awa&#8217; playing, mysel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there was a week of happy preparation, and
then on a fine Monday morning Mr. and Mrs. Ruleson
went to Aberdeen. Margot was satisfied to leave
her house in Christine&#8217;s care, but at the last hour,
she had discovered another likelihood of trouble. It
was the herring.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They are maistly twa weeks earlier, or later than
looked for, Christine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and, of course,
they&#8217;ll be earlier this year. I wouldn&#8217;t wonder that
when we reach Aberdeen, we&#8217;ll find them there, if
they arena at Culraine itsel&#8217;. And if feyther&#8217;s boat
isna leading, it will be that meddlesome Peter
Brodie&#8217;s boat&mdash;and that would rile me a&#8217; the year
through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither, it is too soon for the herrin&#8217;. You
needna fret yoursel&#8217; anent the herrin&#8217;. If there are
any signs o&#8217; the feesh, I&#8217;ll gie young Donald Grant
a smile, and he&#8217;ll watch for them night and day to
pleasure me. I&#8217;ll not let Peter hae a chance to find
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a&#8217; right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when they were fairly gone and out o&#8217; sight,
Christine sat down to consider, and to draw her
personality together. She felt as if there were half-a-dozen
Christines, and she was equally conscious
of an unusual house. Its atmosphere was intense
and restless, and slightly dissatisfied. Christine considered
it for a few moments, and then said, &#8220;Nae
wonder! Everything in it is tapsalterie, and I&#8217;ll
just go through it, and make it tidy and clean, and
proper for the hame-coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Aberdeen railway station they found Neil waiting
for them. He took them to the house he called
&#8220;home.&#8221; It was a very respectable house, in a very
respectable quarter of the city, kept by Mrs. Todd,
a sea-captain&#8217;s widow, a woman with &#8220;relatives weel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
kent, and o&#8217; the better class o&#8217; folk.&#8221; She took to
Margot, and Margot, with some reservations, took
to her. Ruleson was anxious to see the city. From
the small window in his railway carriage his eyes
had rested upon its granite towers and spires, and
he went with Neil to walk down Maraschal and
Union Streets, the latter being a most splendid roadway,
with houses and pavements of gray granite.
For a full mile&#8217;s length, the street looked as if it
had been cut and fashioned out of the solid rock,
for the mortar used could not be seen. There were
splendid shops on these streets, but there was no sign
of a circus, nor of any other place of amusement.</p>
<p>Sitting at tea with the captain&#8217;s widow, he named
this fact. &#8220;I saw naething o&#8217; a circus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
a man with whom I talked a few minutes said there
were no theaters or concert halls, or the like o&#8217; such
places, in Aberdeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sae,&#8221; answered the widow, &#8220;we hae nae
amusements here, but preaching, preaching!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gudeman, why were you seeking information
anent amusements? They arena in your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just makin&#8217; a few interrogatories, Margot.
I wanted to ken how the people passed their days.
I didna see any sign o&#8217; manufactories. What do
they mak&#8217; then in Aberdeen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruleson looked pointedly at the widow as he
spoke, and she answered with an air of quiet superiority.
&#8220;Aberdeen mak&#8217;s men&mdash;men out o&#8217; the
raw material, for a&#8217; the marts and markets o&#8217; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
warld. We hae lads to be made men o&#8217; frae every
part o&#8217; Scotland; for poor lads can get here the best
o&#8217; learning for sma&#8217; cost. They can hae board for
five shilling a week, and the professors&#8217; fees are
only seven or eight pounds a session. A twenty-five-pound
bursary will pay all expenses. Many of the
poor students board themselves, and a great deal
can be done on porridge and milk, and fish, and
meal. And we hae the gentry, too, Sir! plenty of
rich lads, as well as poor ones, and the one kind
helps the ither.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruleson saw both kinds the next day&mdash;hundreds
of braw young lads, running over with the joyous
spirit of youth. Hard to control, yet thoroughly
under control, they filled the large university hall
with an almost intoxicating influence of life. You
could not feel old while breathing it. Yet it all
seemed very much like a church meeting to Margot,
until Neil stepped to the front of the crowded platform.
That sight brought her heart and soul home,
and she laid her hand on her husband&#8217;s hand, and
sat still to listen.</p>
<p>He looked handsome and gentlemanly, and held
a folded paper in his hand. Bowing to the professors,
the provost, and the other dignitaries surrounding
him, he then turned a smiling face to the
audience, and commenced his speech. It was a very
learned discussion on a point of law then causing
international argument, and as his various points
reached their climax, he was warmly applauded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
At its close many stood up in their enthusiasm to
honor him, and in the midst of this excitement, the
president of the Maraschal handed him, with the
set formula, the credentials which made Neil Ruleson
one of Her Majesty&#8217;s gentlemen and councilors-at-law.</p>
<p>Neil&#8217;s father sat motionless, but his grave face
changed like the pages of a book which are being
turned. Margot was almost hysterical. She covered
her face and wept, and all eyes were turned
on her, and every heart said to itself, &#8220;She will be
the lad&#8217;s mother.&#8221; And coming out of the hall,
many nodded to her and smiled. They wanted her
to feel that they rejoiced with her. Outside the
university, Neil joined his father and mother, and
as he passed through the crowd, with his mother
on his arm, he was hailed with the congratulations
both of those who knew him, and those who did not
know him.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful hour to the Ruleson party,
and perhaps only James Ruleson had any shadow of
regret in it. He did not once voice this regret, but
it was present to his thoughts and imagination. Neil
as a gentleman of Scotland and a member of the
Scottish bar was a great honor, but Oh, if he had
seen him in the minister&#8217;s gown and bands, and
heard his first sermon, how much greater his joy!
How much prouder of his son&#8217;s success he would
have been!</p>
<p>But he said nothing to Margot which could dim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
her satisfaction. Mrs. Todd did that quite sufficiently.
She spoke with contempt o&#8217; the fool-like
way Aberdeen folk went on, every time a lad happened
to get a degree, or a bit o&#8217; school honor; and
the thing happening a&#8217; the time, as it were. She
made Margot feel by her short, cool remarks, that
Neil&#8217;s triumph might, after all, be an ordinary affair,
and for a little season took all the glory out of Neil&#8217;s
achievement, though in doing so, she was careful
of the reputation of her native city, and candidly
admitted that in spite of a&#8217; their well-kent scholarship,
Aberdeeners were kindly folk, aye ready to
gie a shout o&#8217; encouragement to a new beginner.</p>
<p>Margot, however, quickly readjusted the dampened
and discouraged feeling Mrs. Todd&#8217;s opinions
induced. &#8220;She&#8217;s just jealous, because Neil is a Fife
lad. That&#8217;s a&#8217; there is to her say-so! I hae heard
often that Aberdeeners were a jealous folk. I&#8217;m
saying naething against their kindliness. They hae
treated Neil weel, and nae doubt they understood
weel enou&#8217; what they were doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neil spent most of the day with his parents, but
about six in the evening he came to them in full
evening dress, and said he was going to the Rath&#8217;s
hotel. &#8220;They have a dinner in my honor,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and the Provost&#8217;s son, and several important
people will be there; and I am to be introduced
to the Hepburn of Hepburn Braes, a great nobleman
in these parts. There will be ladies, too, of
course, and I, am expecting a profitable and pleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
evening.&#8221; And though Margot was quite elated
over her son&#8217;s great friends, Ruleson would have
been far prouder had he known Neil was going to
take the chair at a session of elders connected with
some kirk of which Neil was the Domine.</p>
<p>The next morning they returned to Culraine with
hearts full of memories for which they could thank
God, and they found their son Allan sitting at their
fireside. As soon as Allan saw them enter, he rose
and went to them, and took their hands in his hands,
and said in a voice trembling with emotion, &#8220;Father!
Mother! Your kindness to my little lad has
made you father and mother twice over to me.&#8221;
Then what a happy hour followed! For as they
were sitting down to their evening meal, the Domine
entered. He had heard of Allan&#8217;s visit and had become
anxious about the child, lest he might be taken
from them. And it was during these troubled hours
he bethought him of the necessity for a legal adoption
of little Jamie by his grandfather and himself,
a plan taken into consideration that very night, and
within the next three months made binding as book
and bond could fix it.</p>
<p>The Domine was a welcome addition to the family
party. He slipped with a smile into Christine&#8217;s
place, and she rose and served them with grace and
sweetness. And as she went softly around the table,
replenishing emptied plates, and refilling teacups,
saying nothing, but seeing to everyone&#8217;s comfort, her
beauty took on an extraordinary charm. Woman, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
rather ministering angel, she seemed, and it was
strange that all present took her beautiful service,
as things of spiritual beauty are usually taken, without
much notice. Yet she was that night the golden
band around the table, that kept the sweet influences
of the meal peaceful and unbroken from the beginning
to the end of it. A few happy hours followed,
and then the Domine took Allan back to the manse
with him. &#8220;They are a&#8217; tired here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
you and I, Allan, can talk the night awa&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This they did, but there were only two or three
sentences in their long conversation which concern
this story. They referred to the happy family life
of the Rulesons. &#8220;I never go to your father&#8217;s house,
Allan,&#8221; said the Domine, &#8220;without regretting that I
did not marry. I have come to the conclusion that
marriage is Nature&#8217;s way of coaxing the best out
of us. A man puts his back into the uplift for wife
and children, for to make them happy is better than
riches or fame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still you might have made a mistake, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earth would be heaven, Allan, if we never made
mistakes. But in spite of mistakes, men live contented
with the world, and happy with each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>And if it is not tightly clasped, and well guarded,
it soon fades away, especially if doubt or question
come near it. The heart, which is never weary of
recalling its sorrows, seems to have no echo for its
finer joys. This, however, may be our own fault.
Let us remember for a moment or two how ruthlessly
we transfer yesterday into today, and last week
into this week. We have either no time or no inclination
to entertain joys that have passed. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
are all too quickly retired from our working consciousness,
to some dim, little-visited nook in our
memory. And taken broadly, this is well. Life is
generally precious, according to the strength and
rapidity of its flow, and change is the splendid surge
of a life of this kind. A perfect life is then one
full of changes. It is also a safe life, for it is because
men have no changes, that they fear not God.</p>
<p>Now the people of this little fishing village had
lives lined with change. Sudden deaths were inevitable,
when life was lived on an element so full
of change and peril as the great North Sea. Accidents
were of daily occurrence. Loss of boats and
nets reduced families to unlooked-for poverty. Sons
were constantly going away to strange seas and
strange countries, and others, who had been to the
Arctic Ocean, or the ports of Australia, coming back
home. The miracle of the son&#8217;s being dead and
being alive again, was not infrequently repeated.
Indeed all the tragedies and joys of life found their
way to this small hamlet, hidden among the rocks
and sand dunes that guard the seas of Fife.</p>
<p>Margot&#8217;s triumph was very temporary. It was
not of the ordinary kind. It had in it no flavor of
the sea, and the lad who had won his honors had
never identified himself with the fishers of Culraine.
He did not intend to live among them, and they had
a salutary fear of the law, and no love for it. As
a general thing neither the men nor women of Culraine
cared whether Neil Ruleson won his degree or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
not. Such pleasure as they felt in his success was
entirely for his father&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>And Margot was content that it should be so. She
was not heart-pleased with Neil, and not inclined to
discuss his plans with her neighbors. She noticed
also that Neil&#8217;s father had nothing to say about his
son&#8217;s success, and that if the subject was introduced,
it was coldly met and quickly banished.</p>
<p>It hurt Christine. Her life had been so intermingled
with Neil&#8217;s hopes and plans, she could not
let them drop unnoticed from her consciousness.
&#8220;Why do you say naething anent Neil, Mither?&#8221;
she asked one wet morning, when the boats were in
harbor, and Ruleson had gone down to the new
schoolhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Christine, I hae said a&#8217; there is to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you really disappointed, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Neil succeeded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What way, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His ain way. He has been vera successful i&#8217;
that way, sin&#8217; the day he was born. A wee, shrunken,
puny infant he was, but he hes been a bit too much
for us all&mdash;and there&#8217;s seven big men in our family,
forbye mysel&#8217; and Christine. Whiles I had a glimmering
o&#8217; the real lad, but maistly I did the lad&#8217;s
way&mdash;like the rest o&#8217; us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said he was kind to you and Feyther.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hed to be. It&#8217;s a law, like the laws o&#8217; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Medes and Persians, in Aberdeen, that lads takin&#8217;
honors should pay great attention to their feythers
and mithers. Some were auld and poor&mdash;far poorer
than fisher-folk ever are&mdash;they had worked, and
starved, and prayed for their lads, and they were
going about Aberdeen streets, linked on their lads&#8217;
arms, and all o&#8217; them like to cry wi&#8217; joy. Neil had
to do like the lave, but I let his feyther gae his
lane wi&#8217; him. I wasna carin&#8217; to mak&#8217; a show o&#8217;
mysel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you shouldna blame Neil, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I not? I do, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do wrang?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did little right, and that little he had nae
pleasure in. I know! He should hae spent the
evening wi&#8217; his feyther and mysel&#8217;, and told us what
plans he had made for the future, but he went to
the Raths&#8217; and left us alane. He had promised all
along to come hame wi&#8217; us, and spend a few weeks
wi&#8217; the boats&mdash;your feyther is short-handed since
Cluny Macpherson went awa&#8217;&mdash;and there&#8217;s little doing
in the law business during July and August, but
he said he had an invite to the Raths&#8217; house on the
Isle of Arran, and with them he has gane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sorry, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sae am I, Christine, but when things hae come
to &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8217; there&#8217;s nae gude left i&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he is engaged to Roberta Rath?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna say. I don&#8217;t think he kens himsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see her?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He pointed her out to me. She was getting into
a carriage, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, she was a little body; I saw naething o&#8217; her
but a blue silk dress, and a white lace bonnet. It
would be ordinary, nae doubt. She waved a white-gloved
hand to Neil, and the lad&#8217;s face was like an
illumination. She seemed vera sma&#8217; and thin&mdash;just
a handfu&#8217; o&#8217; her. Naething like yoursel&#8217; and our
ain full-statured, weel-finished women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I had lost Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may do sae, for a man can be lost
by a woman, quite as completely as by the North
Sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Ruleson entered the cottage. He was wet
through, but his face was red with health, and radiant
with excitement. He had been in the new schoolhouse,
and seen three large boxes unpacked. &#8220;Margot!
Christine!&#8221; he cried joyfully, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be to
come down the hill&mdash;the baith o&#8217; you&mdash;and see the
wonderfu&#8217; things that hae come for ordering and
plenishing o&#8217; our school. There&#8217;s a round ball as
big as that table, set in a frame&mdash;and it turns round,
and round, and shows a&#8217; the countries and seas i&#8217; the
wide warld. The Maister said it was called a globe.
There&#8217;s maps o&#8217; Scotland, and England and a&#8217; other
nations to hang on the walls, and they are painted
bonnily; and there&#8217;s nae end o&#8217; copy books and slates,
and bundles o&#8217; pencils, and big bottles o&#8217; ink, and,
Margot, I ne&#8217;er saw sae many school books i&#8217; a&#8217; my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
born days. Naething has been forgotten. The
maister said sae, and the Domine said sae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the Domine there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, was he. He and the maister unpacked the
boxes. Forbye, there is three prizes for the three
best scholars&mdash;the bairns will go wild o&#8217;er them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna tell you. The Domine forbade me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll hae to tell me, gudeman. I&#8217;ll hae nae
secrets between us twa, and I&#8217;m mair than astonished
at the Domine, throwing a married man into
such a temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go wi&#8217; you how, Feyther. I want to see the
wonderfuls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are locked by for today. We are going
to fix the school room Monday, and hae a kind o&#8217;
examination Tuesday. I hope to goodness the herrin&#8217;
will keep to the nor&#8217;ard for a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to your feyther, Christine! Wishing the
herrin&#8217; awa&#8217; for a lot o&#8217; school bairns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Margot, woman, it&#8217;s maist unlikely the
feesh will be here for a week or mair, but they hae
a will and a way o&#8217; their ain, and aince or twice, or
mebbe mair than that, I hae seen them in these pairts
in June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Domine might hae notified Christine.
She ought, by rights, to hae been at that unpacking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Margot, it cam&#8217; my way. I dinna think
my lassie grudges me the pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Christine looked at him with a smile that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
deified her lovely face, and made Ruleson&#8217;s heart
thrill with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wad rayther you had the pleasure than mysel&#8217;,
Feyther. You ken that,&#8221; she said, and Ruleson laid
his hand on her head, and answered: &#8220;I ken it weel!
God bless thee!&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening, while Christine and little Jamie
were busy over Jamie&#8217;s lessons, Margot said to her
husband, &#8220;Gudeman, I&#8217;d like to ken what prizes hae
been bought. The Domine didna include me in his
prohibition, or else he has less sense than I gie him
credit for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I had better tell naebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but you had best tell me. What classes are
you givin&#8217; prizes to? It&#8217;s a vera unusual thing to gie
prizes. I think little o&#8217; paying bairns to learn their
lessons. But they&#8217;re no likely to be worth the looking
at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Deed are they&mdash;vera gude indeed, for the wee
bairns for whom they were bought. There are three
o&#8217; them. The first is for the infant lass, nane o&#8217;
them over six years auld.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Says many a thing you ta&#8217; nae heed to. Just
sae. You needna heed him on this point. Are not
we twa one and the same? Speak out, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;s minding the Domine here? Are you mair
feared for him, than for your wife?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>Then Ruleson, with his great hearty laugh, pulled
a chair to his side, and said, &#8220;Sit down, Margot.
I&#8217;m mair afraid of you, than I am of any man living.
I&#8217;m trem&#8217;ling wi&#8217; fear o&#8217; you, right now, and I&#8217;m just
going to disobey the Domine, for your sake. What
will ye gie me, if I break a promise for your sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep my promise to you, and say naething
anent your transgression. What kind o&#8217; a prize
could they gie to them babies i&#8217; the infant class&mdash;nane
o&#8217; them five years auld? Did you see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I unpacked it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it a rattle, set wi&#8217; wee bells?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naething o&#8217; the kind. It was a big doll, bonnily
dressed, and a little trunk fu&#8217; o&#8217; mair claes, and a
full set o&#8217; doll cheena, and a doll bed and night claes;
wonderfu&#8217;, complete. My goodness! Whoever
gets it will be the proud wee lassie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Polly Craig will be getting it, o&#8217; course.
Who chose the presents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking it was the Domine and the schoolmaster&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they would be knowing wha&#8217; they were buying
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes without the saying. I didna hear onyone
say the doll was for Polly Craig.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I, but Polly&#8217;s mother hasna been to hold,
nor to bind, anent the infant&#8217;s progress. The hale
village is weary o&#8217; the story o&#8217; Polly&#8217;s remarkable
intimacy wi&#8217; her alphabet and spelling. The bairn
may be a&#8217; her mither says, but I&#8217;m thinking she&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
getting her abilities too aerly to be reliable. Weel,
then, who gets the next prize?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Willie Tamsen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken the Tamsens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re nice folk, from the south o&#8217; Fife. Willie
is seven years auld, or thereby. He&#8217;s clever, the
schoolmaster says, in figures and geography, and
weel-behaved, and quiet-like. The Domine says he&#8217;s
first in his catechism class, and vera attentive to a&#8217;
that concerns his lessons&mdash;a good little lad, wi&#8217; an
astonishing power o&#8217; ken in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, what will you gie sae remarkable a bairn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gold guinea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gold guinea! I ne&#8217;er heard o&#8217; such wild extravagance.
It&#8217;s fair sinfu&#8217;. Whate&#8217;er will a lad
o&#8217; seven years auld do wi&#8217; a guinea? Buy sweeties
wi&#8217; it. I dinna think the Domine can sanction a bit
o&#8217; nonsense like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m maist sure the Domine gave the guinea out
o&#8217; his ain pocket. The Tamsens are vera poor, and
the laddie is the warst-dressed lad i&#8217; the village,
and he is to go and get a nice suit o&#8217; claes for himsel&#8217;
wi&#8217; it. The Domine knew what he was doing.
The laddie will be twice as bright, when he gets claes
for his little arms and legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, I hae naething against Willie Tamsen.
He never meddled wi&#8217; my flowers, or stole my berries.
I hope he&#8217;ll get the claes. And there was to
be three prizes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, one for the lads and lasses from eight to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
eleven years old, that takes in a large pairt o&#8217; the
school. The bigger lads and lasses will come in the
autumn, when the herrin&#8217; hae been, and gane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking anything anent that class. I
dinna envy the schoolmaster and mistress that will
hae them to manage. They&#8217;ll hae their hands fu&#8217;,
or my name isna Margot Ruleson. Wha will get
the third prize?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Jamie. And he has weel won it. Jamie
isna a lad o&#8217; the common order. The Domine says
he&#8217;ll mak&#8217; the warld sit up and listen to him, when
he comes to full stature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine is as silly anent the bairn, as you
are. After my ain lad, Neil, I&#8217;m expecting naething
oot o&#8217; the Nazareth o&#8217; Culraine. We were a&#8217; going
to shout o&#8217;er Neil Ruleson&mdash;weel, we hae had our
cry, and dried our eyes, and hae gane on our way
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil has done weel&mdash;considering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gudeman, we hae better drop that &#8216;consideration.&#8217;
I was talking o&#8217; our Jamie. What are they
going to gie our second wonder o&#8217; a bairn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The maist beautiful book you ever saw&mdash;a big
copy of Robinson Crusoe fu&#8217; o&#8217; pictures, and bound
in blue wi&#8217; gold lettering. The bairn will hae wonder
after wonder wi&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you buy the book?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. What mak&#8217;s you ask that information?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naething. Jamie should hae had something he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
could hae halfed wi&#8217; Christine. She has spent the
best o&#8217; her hours teaching the bairn. Few or nane
o&#8217; the lads and lasses would hae the help o&#8217; any
hame lessons. It was really Christine put Neil Ruleson
among her Majesty&#8217;s lawyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then, she&#8217;ll do her pairt in putting James
Ruleson among the ministers o&#8217; the everlasting God.
That will be a great honor, and pay her handsome
for a&#8217; her love and labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gudeman, ministers arena honored as they were
when we were young. If preaching were to go oot
o&#8217; fashion, we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you saying, Margot Ruleson? The
preacher&#8217;s license is to the &#8216;end o&#8217; the warld.&#8217; The
Word o&#8217; the Lord must be gien to men, as long as
men people the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vera weel! The Word o&#8217; the Lord is in everybody&#8217;s
hands the now; and everyone is being taught
to read it. Maist folk can read it as weel as the
minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Word must be made flesh! Nae book can
tak&#8217; the place o&#8217; the face-to-face argument. Preaching
will last as long as men live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, weel, I&#8217;m not going to get you to arguing.
You arena in the clubroom, and I&#8217;m too tired to go
into speculations wi&#8217; you. I&#8217;m obliged to you, gudeman,
for the information you hae imparted. I wad,
however, advise the Domine to gie his next secret
into the keeping o&#8217; some woman, say mysel&#8217;.
Women arena sae amiable as men, and whiles they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
can keep a secret, which is a thing impossible to men-folk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are married, I&#8217;ll admit there are difficulties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gude night, and gude dreams to you, James
Ruleson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye ken weel, Margot, that I never dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sae you lose the half o&#8217; your life, James. I&#8217;m
sorry for you. I shall dream o&#8217; the three happy
bairns, and their prizes. Say, you might hae picked
out another lassie; twa lads to one lass is o&#8217;erganging
what&#8217;s fair. I&#8217;m awa&#8217; to sleep&mdash;you needna answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was trying to the village that Sabbath had to
come and go, before the school examination. But
everything waited for arrives in its time. And this
was a Monday worth waiting for. It was a perfect
June day, and the sea, and the sun, and the wind held
rejoicing with the green earth and the mortals on it.
If there was envy, or jealousy, or bad temper among
the villagers, they forgot it, or put it aside for future
consideration. Everyone was in his best clothes, the
boys and girls being mostly in white, and the little
place looked as if there were a great wedding on
hand. Christine had made an attempt to decorate
the room a little. The boys cut larch boughs and
trailing branches, the men loaned the flags of the
boats, the women gave the few flowers from their
window pots, and strips of garden, and Margot, a
little sadly, cut her roses, and gave permission to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
Christine to add to them a few laburnum branches,
now drooping with their golden blossoms.</p>
<p>The room looked well. The flowers and the flags
did not hide the globe and the maps. And the blackboard
kept its look of authority, though a branch of
laburnum bent over it. The schoolmaster was playing
a merry Fantasia as the company gathered, but
at a given signal from Christine he suddenly changed
it to the children&#8217;s marching song, and the rapid, orderly
manner in which it led each class to its place
was a wonderful sight to the men and women who
had never seen children trained to obedience by music.</p>
<p>The Domine opened the examination by reading,
in the intense silence that followed the cessation of
the music, three verses from the eighteenth chapter
of St. Luke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;And they brought unto him infants that he would touch
them, but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Jesus called them unto him, and said, &#8216;Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such
is the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the
Kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter
therein.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the schoolmistress touched a hand bell and
a crowd of little children, none over five years old,
gathered round her. Contrary to the usual practice
of children, their behavior and recitals were better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
than usual, and laughter and hand-clapping followed
all their simple efforts. Polly Craig was their evident
leader, and when she had told a charming story
about a little girl who would do what she ought not
to do, the records of the class were read by the
Domine, and the prize awarded to Polly.</p>
<p>Willie Tamsen and Jamie Ruleson&#8217;s classes were
treated in a similar way, and were equally successful
in their recitations and equally delighted with their
gifts. Now, the real joy in giving gifts is found in
giving them to children, for the child heart beats
long after we think it has outgrown itself. The perfect
charm of this gathering lay in the fact that men
and women became for a few hours little children
again. It was really a wonderful thing to see the
half-grown girls, the married women, and even old
Judith Macpherson, crowding round Polly to admire
the waxen beauty and the long fair curls of her prize
doll.</p>
<p>After the school exercises the adults slowly scattered,
sauntering home with their wives, and carrying
their babies as proudly as Polly carried her new
treasure. Truly both men and women receive the
kingdom of God and Love, when they become as little
children. The children remained for two hours
longer in the school room. For the entertainment of
their parents the youngest ones had danced some
of those new dances just at that period introduced
into Scotland, called polkas and mazurkas, and now,
to please themselves, they began a series of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
mythic games which children played in the world&#8217;s
infancy, and which, thank God, have not yet perished
from off the face of the earth. &#8220;How many miles
to Babylon?&#8221; &#8220;Hide and seek,&#8221; &#8220;In and out,&#8221;
&#8220;Blind man&#8217;s buff,&#8221; and so forth, and in this part of
the entertainment, everything and everyone depended
upon Christine. Mothers, going home,
called to her, &#8220;Christine, look after my bairn,&#8221; and
then went contentedly away.</p>
<p>They might contentedly do so, for whoever saw
Christine Ruleson that afternoon, in the midst of
those forty or fifty children, saw something as near
to a vision of angels, as they were likely to see on
this earth. She stood among them like some divine
mother. A little one three years old was on her
right arm. It pulled her earrings, and rumpled her
hair, and crushed her lace collar, and she only kissed
and held it closer. A little lad with a crooked spine,
and the seraphic face which generally distinguishes
such sufferers, held her tightly by her right hand.
Others clung to her dress, and called her name in
every key of love and trust. She directed their
games, and settled their disputes, and if anything
went wrong, put it right with a kiss.</p>
<p>The Domine watched her for ten or fifteen minutes,
then he went slowly up the hill. &#8220;Where at
a&#8217; is Christine, Domine?&#8221; asked Margot. &#8220;I&#8217;m
wanting her sairly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine is too busy to meddle with, Margot.
She&#8217;s doing God&#8217;s best work&mdash;ministering to little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
children. As I saw her half-an-hour ago, she was
little lower than the angels. I&#8217;m doubting if an
angel could be lovelier, or fuller of life and love,
and every sweet influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine is a handsome lass, nae doubt o&#8217; that,
but our women are all o&#8217; them heritage handsome.
I&#8217;m doubting if Eve, being a Jewess, could be worth
evening wi&#8217; us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eve was not a Jewess. She was God&#8217;s eldest
daughter, Margot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then God&#8217;s eldest daughter hasna a very gude
character. She has been badly spoken of, ever since
the warld began. And I do hope my Christine will
behave hersel&#8217; better than Eve did&mdash;if all&#8217;s true
that is said anent her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine is a good girl, Margot. If little children
love a woman, and she loves them, the love
of God is there. Margot! Margot! God comes to
us in many ways, but the sweetest and tenderest of
all of them, is when he sends Jesus Christ by the way
of the cradle.&#8221;</p>
<p>All&#8217;s well that ends well. If this be true, the first
session of Culraine school was a great success. It
had brought an entirely new, and very happy estimate
of a father&#8217;s and a mother&#8217;s duty to their children.
It had even made them emulous of each
other, in their care and attention to the highest wants
of childhood.</p>
<p>The whole village was yet talking of the examination
when the herring came. Then every woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
went gladly to her appointed post and work, and
every man&mdash;rested and eager for labor&mdash;hailed the
news with a shout of welcome. Peter Brodie&#8217;s big
Sam brought it very early one lovely summer morning,
and having anchored his boat, ran through the
sleeping village shouting&mdash;&#8220;Caller Herrin&#8217;! In Culraine
Bay!&#8221;</p>
<p>The call was an enchantment. It rang like a trumpet
through the sleeping village, and windows were
thrown up, and doors flung open, and half-dressed
men were demanding in stentorian voices, &#8220;Where
are the fish, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside Culraine Bay,&#8221; he answered, still keeping
up his exultant cry of &#8220;Caller Herrin&#8217;!&#8221; and in less
than half an hour men were at work preparing for
the amazing physical strain before them. Much was
to do if they were to cast their nets that evening, and
the streets were soon busy with men and lads carrying
nets and other necessities to the boats. It was
up with the flag on every boat in commission, for the
fishing, and this day&#8217;s last preparations excited the
place as if it were some great national holiday. The
women were equally full of joyful business. They
had to cook the breakfast, but immediately after it
were all in the packing and curing sheds. You would
have been sure they were keeping holiday. Pleasant
greetings, snatches of song, encouraging cries to the
men struggling down to the boats with the leaded
nets, shouts of hurry to the bewildered children, little
flytings at their delays, O twenty different motives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
for clamor and haste were rife, and not unpleasant,
because through all there was that tone of equal interest
and good fellowship that can never be mistaken.</p>
<p>Margot had insisted on a visit to her special shed,
to see whether all was in readiness for her special
labor, but Christine had entreated her to wait for
her return from the town, where she was going for
orders. She had left her mother with the clear understanding
that she would not risk the walk and the
chatter and the clatter until the following day. But
as soon as she was alone, Margot changed her
intentions. &#8220;I must make the effort,&#8221; she said to
herself. &#8220;I&#8217;m feared of the pain, that&#8217;s all about
it.&#8221; So she made the effort, and found out that
there was something more than fear to be reckoned
with.</p>
<p>Christine brought home astonishing orders, and
Margot&#8217;s face flushed with pride and energy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
not let that order slip through my fingers,&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to the kippering, and what I canna do,
Christine can manage, following my say-so.&#8221;</p>
<p>This change in Margot&#8217;s work was the only
shadow on that year&#8217;s herring-tide. It was a change,
however, that all felt would not be removed. Margot
said, with a little laugh, that she was teaching
her lassie how to make a living, or how to help
some gudeman to do it. &#8220;And I have a fine scholar,&#8221;
she soon began to add. &#8220;Christine can now kipper
a herring as weel as her mother, and why not? She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
has seen the kippering done, ever since she wore
ankle tights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will be glad of a bit rest to yourself,
Margot, no doubt,&#8221; was the general answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I have turned the corner of womanhood, and
I&#8217;m wearing away down the hillside of life. I hae
been in a dowie and desponding condition for a year
or mair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine is clever with business, and folks do
say she has a full sense of the value of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, Nancy. There&#8217;s no harm in the like
of that. Her feyther came from Aberdeen folk, and
it&#8217;s weel recognized that Aberdeen folk look at both
sides of a penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine is a clever lass, and good likewise, we
were all saying that, a while ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, some folk, out of bad taste, or a natural
want of good sense, may think different; but there&mdash;that&#8217;s
enough on the subject of Christine. Her
feyther is gey touchy anent Christine, and it will be
as weel to let that subject alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, day after day, Margot sat in a chair at her
daughter&#8217;s side, and Christine filled the big orders
as her mother instructed her. And they were well
filled, in good time, and the outcome was beyond all
expectation. Yet Christine looked sadly at the
money, and Margot turned her head away, to hide
the unbidden tears in her eyes, as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all yours, lassie. I&#8217;ll not touch a farthing of
it. You have fairly won it. It will happen help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
Neil&#8217;s deficiencies. Oh, my dear lassie! Mither has
done her last kippering! I feel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll kipper for you, Mither, as long as we
both live. The hill is now o&#8217;er much for you&mdash;and
the noisy women, and skirling bairns! Christine
will go to Mother&#8217;s shed, and Mother will bide at
hame, and red up the house, and have a cup of tea
ready for hungry folk, as they come weary hame.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Margot let it go at that, but she was as she
said, &#8220;dowie and despondent.&#8221; Ruleson begged her
to go with him to Edinburgh, and get the advice of
a good physician, but Margot would not listen to any
entreaty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll no do any such thing,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Not
likely! The Domine can gie the pain a setback, and
if God wants me here, He&#8217;ll keep me here, sick or
well, and if He doesna want me here, I&#8217;m willing
to go where He does want me.&#8221; From this position
Margot was not movable, and now that the herring
fishing was over, there did not appear to be any reason
for making her restless and unhappy. So she
naturally drifted into that household position, where
everyone took care not to tire, and not to vex, grandmother.</p>
<p>One morning in the early days of October, Christine
was sitting sewing, and Margot was making
shortcake. They had been talking of Neil and wondering
where he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking it is whole o&#8217; a month, since we
heard from the lad,&#8221; said Margot.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I dare say it&#8217;s mair, Mother; and that letter
was from some strange French seaside place, and
he was thinking that they wouldna stay there very
long. He has mebbe gane further awa&#8217; than
France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t wonder&mdash;setting a young man traveling
is like setting a ball rolling down a hill. Baith
o&#8217; them are hard to turn back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot had scarcely finished speaking, when Sam
Brodie opened the door. He had been to the town
post office and seen, in the list of uncalled-for letters,
a letter addressed to Christine, so he had brought it
along. It proved to be from Neil, and had been
posted in Rome. Christine was familiar with that
postmark, and it still had power at least to raise her
curiosity. Neil&#8217;s handwriting, however, spoke for
itself, and before she broke the seal, she said, &#8220;Why,
Mither! It is from Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that, as soon as Sam came in. I was
dreaming of a letter from Neil, last night. I dinna
dream for naething. Make haste with the news&mdash;good
or bad&mdash;read it all. I want to hear the warst
of <ins title='Added quote'>it.&#8221;</ins> Then Christine read aloud the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Christine,</span></p>
<p>I want you to tell Mother that I married Miss Rath in
Paris on the fifth of September ult. We were afraid that
Reginald was going to interfere, so we settled the matter
to prevent quarreling&mdash;which, you know, is against my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
nature. Reginald&#8217;s opposition was quite unlooked for and,
I must say, very ill-natured and discouraging. If there is
anything in a man&#8217;s life he should have full liberty and
sympathy in, it is his marriage. I dare say Mother will
have some complaint or other to make. You must talk to
her, until she sees things reasonably. We were married in
the Protestant Episcopal Church in Paris, very quietly&mdash;only
the necessary witnesses&mdash;and came on here at once. I disapproved
so highly of Reginald&#8217;s behavior at this important
period of my life, and of some insulting things he said to
me, that I have resolved not to have any more relations with
him. After all I have done for him, it is most disheartening.
My wife feels her brother&#8217;s conduct very much, but
she has perfect trust in me. Of course, if I had been married
in Scotland, I would have had my friends&#8217; presence,
but I am quite sure that my best interests demanded an
immediate marriage. We shall be home in a month, and
then I propose to open a law office in Glasgow <i>in my own
name</i>. I shall do better without impedimenta like Reginald
Rath. I trust to you to make all comfortable at home. I
shall desire to bring my wife to see my mother. I am proud
of Roberta. She is stylish, and has a good deal more money
than I expected. I shall not require Reginald&#8217;s money or
patronage, they would now be offensive to my sense of honor
and freedom. Give my love to my father and mother, and
remember I am</p>
<p class='sig1'>Always your loving brother,</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Neil.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a few moments&#8217; dead silence, and
Christine did not lift her eyes from the paper in her
hand, until a passionate exclamation from Margot
demanded her notice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mither, Mither!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;dinna mak&#8217;
yoursel&#8217; sick; it&#8217;s Neil, our Neil, that you are calling
a scoundrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll call a scoundrel by no ither name. It&#8217;s
gude enough for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were talking one hour ago about him marrying
Miss Rath, and you took to the idea then.
Now that he has done so, what for are you railing
at him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not railing at him for marrying the lass, she&#8217;s
doubtless better than he deserves. It&#8217;s the way that
he&#8217;s done the business&mdash;the mean, blackguardly way
he&#8217;s done the business, that shames and angers me.
Dod! I would strike him on the face, if he was near
my hand. I&#8217;m shamed o&#8217; him! He&#8217;s a black disgrace
to his father and mother, and to all the kind he
came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, Mother, folks would say
that Neil had done weel to himsel&#8217; and praise him
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you alluding to? Dinna call the name
&#8216;Neil&#8217; in my hearing. Scoundrel is gude enough to
specify a scoundrel. I hae counts against him, and
he must clear himself, before I&#8217;ll pass his christened
name o&#8217;er my lips.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are your counts against him? Maybe I
can speak a word to explain them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you! First, he has, beyond a&#8217; doubt, deceived
the lass&#8217;s brother. He should hae spoken to
him first of all, and the young man wouldna hae said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
insulting words if there wasna cause for the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady was of full age, and sae had the right
to please herself, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had not. She was as bad as Neil, or she
would have sought her brother&#8217;s consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Neil wouldna let her tell her brither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like enough. He has got the girl, and
that means he has got full control o&#8217; her money.
Then he breaks his promise to go into partnership
in business with the brother, and will open a law
office in his ain name! He&#8217;ll open it, ye ken, wi&#8217; the
Rath siller, in his ain name! Having got plenty o&#8217;
the Rath siller to set himsel&#8217; up, he drops the man
whom he used to fleech and flatter enou&#8217; to sicken
a honest man. And he trusts to you to mak&#8217; all
comfortable here&mdash;but no word or whisper anent
the ninety pounds he&#8217;s owing you. He has gotten
mair money than he expectit wi&#8217; his stolen wife, and
yet he hasna a thought for the sister wha emptied
the small savings o&#8217; her lifetime into his unthankfu&#8217;
hands. Wae&#8217;s me, but I&#8217;m the sorrowfu&#8217; mither this
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a&#8217; that, Mither, dinna mak&#8217; yoursel&#8217; sick.
Luck o&#8217; some kind threw the Rath siller in Neil&#8217;s
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, and the scoundrel has ta&#8217;en all he could get
o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way o&#8217; the warld, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the way o&#8217; honest, honorable men. He
ought to hae spoken to the young man plainly, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
he ought not to hae quarreled wi&#8217; him anent their
business proposal. I understand that the Rath lad
was na very knowing in the law nor indeed notable
for managing his ain affairs, in any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Mither, it comes to this&mdash;Neil had made
up his mind to tak&#8217; his living out o&#8217; the Rath purse,
and he finally decided that he would rayther tak&#8217; it
from the lady, than the gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot laughed at this remark. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not be
far wrang in that observe, Christine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
the lad may be far out o&#8217; his reckoning, and I&#8217;m not
carin&#8217; if it be so. Nae doubt he thought the lassie
wad be easier controlled than her brither, who, I
was led to believe, had a vera uncertain temper.
Roberta may pay a&#8217; our wrangs yet. Little women
are gey often parfect Tartars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither! Mither! You wouldn&#8217;t wish your ain
lad to marry a Tartar o&#8217; a wife, and sae be miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I? A stranger winning their way wi&#8217;
the Raths&#8217; siller, wouldna hae troubled me, it would
hae been out o&#8217; my concern. Christine, there are
two things no good woman likes to do. One is to
bring a fool into the warld, and the other is to bring
one o&#8217; them clever fellows, who live on other people&#8217;s
money, instead o&#8217; working their way up, step
by step. I&#8217;m shamed o&#8217; my motherhood this
day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, Mither! Think of Norman, and Allan,
and the lave o&#8217; the lads!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And forbye, I think shame o&#8217; any son o&#8217; mine
being married in a foreign country, in France itsel&#8217;,
the French being our natural enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just now, Mither, not just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our natural enemies! and a kind o&#8217; people, that
dinna even speak like Christians. Ye ken I hae
heard their language in this vera room, Christine,
and sorry I am to hae permitted the like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nae harm in it, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It led him astray. If Ruleson&#8217;s lad hadna kent
the French tongue, he would hae persuaded thae
Raths that America was the only place to see the
warld in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mither, he went to the English church in
France&mdash;the Protestant Episcopal Church!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another great wrang to our family. The Rulesons
are of the best Covenanting stock. What would
John Knox say to a Ruleson being married in an
Episcopal Church, at the very horns o&#8217; the altar, as
it were? An unchristened Turk could do naething
more unfitting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither, I hear feyther and Jamie coming up the
hill. Let us hae peace this night. We will tak&#8217;
counsel o&#8217; our pillows, and in the morning we&#8217;ll see
things in a different way, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the scorn Margot threw into the seven letters
of that one word, &#8220;perhaps,&#8221; would have been an
impossibility to any woman less ignorant, or less
prejudiced in favor of her own creed and traditions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
For it is in Ignorance that Faith finds its most invincible
stronghold.</p>
<p>Ruleson came in with a newspaper in his hand.
Jamie was with him, but as soon as he entered the
cottage, he snuggled up to his grandmother, and told
her softly, &#8220;Grandfather has had some bad news. It
came in a newspaper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grandfather, however, said not a word concerning
bad news, until he had had his tea, and smoked a
pipe. Then Christine and Jamie went to Christine&#8217;s
room to read, and Ruleson, after tapping the bowl
of his pipe on the hob until it was clean, turned to
Margot, and said, &#8220;Gudewife, I hae news today o&#8217;
Neil&#8217;s marriage to Miss Rath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Christine had a letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think o&#8217; the circumstance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering, when it was in a foreign country,
and outside his ain kirk and creed, whether it
was legal and lawful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil is lawyer enough to ken he was all right. It
is not the law side o&#8217; the question I am thinking of.
It is the hame side. Not a word to his ain folk, and
not one o&#8217; us present at the ceremony!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither were any of the lady&#8217;s family present.
It was, I&#8217;m thinking, a marriage after Neil Ruleson&#8217;s
ain heart. Neil first, and last, and altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that? The young man, her brother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil has quarreled wi&#8217; him. Neil has got the
lady and her money, and he is going to begin business
in his ain name, exclusive! I consider Neil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
something o&#8217; a scoundrel, and a mean one, at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking to Finlay anent the matter, and he
says Neil has done weel to himsel&#8217;, and he thinks
him a gey clever young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d like to have Finlay keep his false tongue
out o&#8217; my family affairs. I say Neil has done a dirty
piece o&#8217; business with the Raths, and that will be
seen, and heard tell o&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was saying, Margot, it is the hame side o&#8217;
the affair that gave me a shock. To think of a&#8217; we
hae done, of a&#8217; his brithers hae done, and of the
siller he got frae his sister! To think o&#8217; it! Only
to think o&#8217; it! And not ane o&#8217; us bid to his wedding.
It fairly staggers me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nae wonder, gudeman! It&#8217;s an unspeakable
business! I&#8217;ll not talk o&#8217; it! The lad I nursed on
my heart, and he&#8217;s fairly broken it at last. He&#8217;s a
sinful creature!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all o&#8217; us sinfu&#8217; creatures, Margot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not. You are much mista&#8217;en, James.
There&#8217;s plenty o&#8217; good men and women on every side
o&#8217; us. Neither you, nor mysel&#8217;, would do as Neil
has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not&mdash;but we baith hae our ain way o&#8217;
sinning, Margot, you ken that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak for yoursel&#8217;, gudeman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Finlay said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kay! Kay! I&#8217;ll no be fashed wi&#8217; Finlay&#8217;s foolishness.
I&#8217;m awa&#8217; to my sleep. My lad, my dear
lad, you are heart-weary. I&#8217;m sorry for you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, Margot. Finlay says he has
nae doubt Neil has married ten thousand pounds a
year. Think o&#8217; that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think of nae such foolishness. And if it was
twenty thousand, the lad would need it all&mdash;we hae
brought him up sae badly!&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot disappeared with the words, and the unhappy
father as he covered the fire, and pottered
about the house, said sorrowfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s right! She&#8217;s always right. If her words
are in the way o&#8217; reproach, it&#8217;s my fault! James
Ruleson&#8217;s fault! I ought to hae stood out against
the Maraschal. If we had made him a minister, he
would hae been obligated to set an example to a
kirkful o&#8217; men and women, and folks will sin against
their ain house, when they will do their duty to a
kirkful.&#8221;</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> winter following Neil&#8217;s marriage was a
pleasant one to the village of Culraine. The
weather was favorable, the line fishing more
than usually prosperous, and the school remarkably
successful. Ruleson took the greatest delight in its
progress, and nothing gave him greater pleasure
than a walk in its vicinity, when he could see the children
coming and going, with their books and balls
in their hands. They all knew him, but however
large the group in the playground, he could pick little
Jamie out of it in a moment. And oh, how good it
was to see the old man defying his failure with Neil,
and building still grander hopes on this lad of ten
years old! Truly, from the good heart Hope springs
eternal. It forgets that it is mortal, because it takes
hold on immortality.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>Christine heard constantly from Cluny, but it was
nearly a year since she had seen him, for the crew
of a passenger steamer trading to foreign ports, do
not obtain leave easily, especially in their first year.
And Cluny had never been in Glasgow port long
enough to make a journey to Culraine and back possible.
Christine did not fret herself because of his
absence. She was not as one of the foolish ones,
who regard a lover and love-making as the great
essential of life. She had proved in her own case,
that Duty was far above, and beyond Love. She
had known cases where Honor had been put before
Love. She had seen Angus Ballister put mere social
caste before Love. It was a fact known to all the
world, that gold laughed at Love, and bought and
sold Love, as if he were merchandise in the market
place.</p>
<p>She loved Cluny, but her love was subject to her
duty, which at present was evidently in her own
home. Her father was strong and full of the joy
of living, but his work was on the winter seas, and
he needed the comfort of a well-ordered house and
properly-cooked food after his hard day&#8217;s fishing.
Her mother was sick and failing, and it appeared to
Christine&#8217;s anxious heart that she was losing, instead
of gaining, ground. Margot denied this position,
but Christine noticed that one little household duty
after another was allowed to drift quietly into her
hands. Then also there was Jamie, whom she tenderly
loved, and who was wholly dependent on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
care and help. His food&mdash;his clothes&mdash;his lessons!
What could Jamie do without her?</p>
<p>One morning in February, she had a letter from
Cluny, which set at naught all these claims. He had
two hundred pounds in the Bank of Scotland, and he
wanted to get married. He was studying navigation,
and he would be third officer in another year.
He was fairly wasting his life without Christine.
He was growing old with the disappointment he was
getting constantly. He was next door to dying, with
one put-off after another. If he came up on the fifteenth,
would she walk over to the Domine&#8217;s with
him? He felt as if the Domine might bury him, if
he didna marry him. He declared he had been sick
with the love and pain of wanting her, ever since he
could remember himself, &#8220;and yet, Christine,&#8221; he
wrote, &#8220;you are mine. Mine from your birth hour.
Mine whether you love me, or don&#8217;t love me. Mine
if you marry someone else. Mine even if you die,
for then I would soon follow, and find you out, wherever
you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was a girl of cool, reasonable nature, to do
with a lover of this impetuous, vehement temper?</p>
<p>She told her mother that Cluny was coming, and
she noticed that the news instantly changed the atmosphere
of the room. Margot had been sewing
and chatting cheerfully in her chair by the fireside.
She dropped her work, and became thoughtful and
silent. Christine knew why, and she said to herself,
&#8220;Mither is fearing I am going to marry Cluny, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
leave her alane! As if I would! The man never
lived, who could make me do the like o&#8217; that.&#8221; She
waited ten minutes to give Margot time to recover
herself, but as she did not do so, she asked, &#8220;Mither,
are you doubting Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dearie! I couldna do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doubting mysel&#8217;. Doubting my power to
look to your feyther&#8217;s comfort, and the like o&#8217; that,
and maybe fearing a strange woman in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why a strange woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s things I canna do now&mdash;things I havna
the strength for, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that Christine would leave you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, there is the peradventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither, put your arm round me. To the end
of your life, Christine will put hers round you. Naebody
can part us twa. Naebody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Cluny was coming&mdash;and&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would leave you. Leave you now! Leave you,
and leave feyther without anyone to cook his meals,
and leave wee Jamie, who looks to me as if I was his
Mither. Na, na! You mustna judge Christine in
that way. What for would I leave you? Because a
lad loves me out of a&#8217; sense and reason. Even if I
was his wife, love and duty would count your claim
first. God said a man should leave feyther and
mither, and cleave to his wife; but He didna tell a
woman to leave her feyther and mither, and cleave
to her husband.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He would mean it, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then He would hae said it. He leaves nae room
to question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be what is called &#8216;inferences.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, Mither! It is thus and so, and do, and
do not, wi&#8217; God. There&#8217;s nae inferences in any o&#8217;
His commands. When folks break them, they ken
well they are breaking them. But what will we be
talking o&#8217; this matter for? You yoursel&#8217; are beyond
the obligation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ne&#8217;er had it, I may say, for my feyther was
drowned ere I was born, and my mither died ere I
was five years old. It&#8217;s different wi&#8217; you, dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, but Christine kens all o&#8217; her duty, and it
will be her pleasure to fulfill it.&#8221; And she clasped
her mother&#8217;s hands in hers, and kissed her. And
Margot&#8217;s old pawky smile flitted o&#8217;er her face, and
she said, &#8220;We must ask the Domine anent this question&#8221;&mdash;then
a little sarcastically&mdash;&#8220;or Neil will gie
us the Common Law o&#8217; Scotland concerning it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the trouble ended with a smile and the shout
of Jamie as he flung open the house door, in a storm
of hurry and pleasure. &#8220;Auntie! Grandmither!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;We are going to have a tug-of-war between
the English and the Scotch, on the playground, at
half-past twelve. I&#8217;m on the Scotch side. Gie me
my dinner, Auntie, and I&#8217;ll be awa&#8217; to help floor
Geordie Kent, and the rest of his upsetting crowd.
Geordie&#8217;s mither is English, and he&#8217;s always boasting
about the circumstance.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to tak&#8217; the brag out o&#8217; him,
Jamie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to help do so, with all my might, but
there&#8217;s some Border lads among the English set, and
they are a hefty lot, and hard to beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Jamie! Fife lads shout when the
boat wins the harbor, not till then. All the same,
laddie, bring me word o&#8217; your victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>When dinner was over Christine dressed herself
for her visitor, and the light of love and expectation
gave to her face an unusual beauty. She wore
her fisher costume, for she thought Cluny would like
it best, but it was fresh and bright and quite coquettish,
with its pretty fluted cap, its gold earrings,
its sky-blue bodice and skirt of blue and yellow
stripes, and the little kerchief of vivid scarlet round
her shoulders. Its final bit of vanity was a small
white muslin apron, with little pockets finished off
with bows of scarlet ribbon. If she had dressed herself
for a fashionable masquerade ball she would
have been its most picturesque belle and beauty.</p>
<p>It was seven o&#8217;clock when Cluny arrived. Ruleson
had gone to a meeting of the School Trustees, a business,
in his opinion, of the very greatest importance;
and Margot&#8217;s womanly, motherly sense told her that
Cluny would rather have her absence than her company.
So she had pleaded weariness, and gone to
her room soon after tea was over, and Cluny had
&#8220;the fair opportunity,&#8221; he so often declared he never
obtained; for Margot had said to Jamie, &#8220;You&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
come and sit wi&#8217; me, laddie, and gie me the full story
o&#8217; your bloody defeat, and we&#8217;ll mak&#8217; a consultation
anent the best way o&#8217; mending it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is glorious!&#8221; cried Cluny, as he stood alone
with Christine in the firelit room. &#8220;I have you all
to mysel&#8217;! Oh, you woman of all the world, what
have you to say to me this night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to say, Cluny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me that you&#8217;ll go before the Domine with
me, in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Cluny, if you are going to begin that trouble
again, I will not stay with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble, trouble? What trouble? Is it a trouble
to be my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you before, I could not marry you till
the right time came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the right time now! It has to be! I&#8217;ll wait
no longer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will wait forever, if you talk that way to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my ain life, Christine, rayther than hae
it crumbled awa&#8217; between your cruel fingers and lips!
aye writing, and saying, &#8216;at the proper time&#8217;! God
help me! When is the proper time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When my mither is better, and able to care for
hersel&#8217;, and look after feyther and the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she any better than she was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, I&#8217;m feared she is worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is maybe dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am feared she is.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then if I wait till she dies&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Cluny! How dare you calculate anything
for my life, on my mither&#8217;s death? Do you
think I would walk from her grave to the altar to
marry you? I would hae to lose every gude sense,
and every good feeling I have, ere I could be sae
wicked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that after your mither&#8217;s death, you
will still keep me waiting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know right well, Cluny, what our folk would
say, if I didna observe the set time of mourning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scot! That&#8217;s a full year!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay. If a bairn dies in our village, its folk wear
blacks for a year. Would I grudge a year&#8217;s respect
for my mither&#8217;s memory? Forbye there would be
my poor heart-broken feyther, and a&#8217; his needs and
griefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the bairn, too, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, you&#8217;re right. The bairn is in our keeping, till
he is fourteen. Then he goes to Domine Trenaby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the next storm will mak&#8217; an end o&#8217; me!
I&#8217;m a broke man, in every worth-while. I hae money
to mak&#8217; a home, but I canna hae a home without a
wife, and the wife promised me puts one mountain
after another in the way, that no man can win over&#8221;&mdash;and
he passionately clasped and unclasped his
hands, while tears, unrecognized, flowed freely, and
somewhat relieved the heart tension that for a few
moments made him speechless.</p>
<p>It seems natural for a woman to weep, but it sends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
a thrill of pity and fear through a woman&#8217;s heart to
see a man break down in unconscious and ungovernable
weeping. Christine was shocked and
strangely pitiful. She soothed, and kissed, and comforted
him, with a gracious abandon she had never
before shown. She could not alter circumstances,
but she strengthened him for the bearing of them.
She actually made him confess that she would lose
something in his estimation, if she was capable of
leaving her mother under present conditions. In
his embrace she wept with him, and both of them
learned that night the full sweetness of a love that
is watered with mutual tears.</p>
<p>So, at the last, she made him strong and confident
in hopes for the future, because God is love, and the
circumstances that separated them were of His ordering.
And Christine would think no ill of God,
she was sure that life and death, and all things God
ordained, were divinely good; and her influence overarched
and enveloped Cluny, and perhaps for the
first time, the real meaning of life and its difficulties
pealed through his heart and brain.</p>
<p>Then as they were talking, Ruleson returned, and
Ruleson, liking Cluny well, was rejoiced to see him,
and they talked together with the greatest interest,
while Christine placed upon the table the simple luxuries
she had prepared for this anticipated meal. It
was indeed a wonderfully happy meal, prolonged by
interesting conversation till nearly midnight, for
Ruleson wanted to hear all Cluny could tell about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the Mediterranean, and Cluny was pleased to listen
to Ruleson&#8217;s enthusiastic description of the good
work the school was doing.</p>
<p>When Cluny at length rose to depart, Ruleson
asked the date of his ship&#8217;s next visit to Glasgow,
and then promised to meet him there, and to bring
Christine with him for a two or three days&#8217; pleasuring.
Cluny was delighted, for though Christine only
shook her head and smiled, he believed that in some
way or other the visit could be managed. And Margot
was enthusiastic about it. She said Christine
must ask Faith to come and stay with her, and Norman
would come to her through the night in case of
trouble, and the Domine would call and see her, and
wee Jamie was comfort and help baith. &#8220;Forbye,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;I&#8217;m wanting to hear a&#8217; about Neil and
his wife, and their way o&#8217; living, Christine, and if
you&#8217;ll just make them an hour&#8217;s passing call, you can
gie me a vera clear idea o&#8217; the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the hastily projected trip became an anticipatory
pleasure for which there was constant preparation
going on. It was a wonderful prospect to Christine,
who had never been five miles from her home, and
Margot entered heartily into the scheme for making
it a notable affair. She said the time was a lucky ordering,
for it was near enough Easter to warrant a
new spring suit, and she gave Christine a five-pound
note, and sent her into the town to buy one. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
get your ain choice, lassie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m thinking,
if it should be o&#8217; a light pearly-gray, it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
suit you weel, and get your gloves and parasol o&#8217; the
same shade, as near as may be, but buy your bonnet
in Glasgow town, for you will hae the height o&#8217; the
fashion there, and scores o&#8217; shops to choose from.&#8221;</p>
<p>So for nearly a month this pleasant expectation
kept the Ruleson cottage busy and happy. Christine&#8217;s
pearly-gray cashmere dress came home, and
was greatly admired, even by the Domine, who also
took a great interest in the proposed visit to Glasgow.
He advised her to send Neil word, as soon as
she arrived there:</p>
<p>&#8220;And do as you have always done, Christine,
strive for peace and family unity. There have been
wrongs, no doubt, but you Rulesons have all nursed
one mother&#8217;s breast, and learned your prayers at
one mother&#8217;s knees, so if there is any little trouble
between Neil and yourself, Christine, forgive it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Neil, I hae loved him all my life, Sir. I
intend to go on loving him. Ninety pounds could
not part us. No, nor ninety hundred pounds.
There&#8217;s no money&#8217;s-worth, can count love&#8217;s-worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>How does a young girl feel on the eve of her first
pleasure journey, when she has pretty new clothing
to wear, and money enough to spend, and is going
in the care of an indulgent father to have fresh and
unknown entertainments, with a lover who adores
her, and whom she admires and truly loves? Is she
not happy and joyous, and full of eager anticipation?
And it was the last day of waiting. The valise
which held her new dress and her father&#8217;s best suit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
was packed, Faith had readily taken hold of the
house duties, and Margot had been, and was, unusually
well and active. Ruleson had gone fishing
&#8220;to pass the time,&#8221; he said, and all was ready for
the early start they proposed to make in the morning.</p>
<p>Ruleson generally came home in time for his six
o&#8217;clock meal, but Christine, standing at the open door
about four o&#8217;clock, saw him making for the harbor.
&#8220;Father&#8217;s just like a bairn,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I&#8217;m gey
uplifted mysel&#8217;, but I&#8217;m plum steady, to what he is.&#8221;
Then Margot joined her. &#8220;Is that your feyther
coming, Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, it&#8217;s feyther, sure enou&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for is he coming at this time o&#8217; day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just in a wave o&#8217; excitement, he isna heeding
what the clock says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, you hed better put on the kettle; he&#8217;s used
to eating as soon as he comes hame, and if his head
is wrang anent the time, his stomach is doubtless
wrang anent its eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the women went inside, and Christine put on
the kettle, and Margot began to lay the cloth, and
set the china on the table. It took Ruleson about
half an hour to walk between his boat and his house,
but suddenly Margot noticed that he was overdue,
and yet not in sight. She called Christine, and they
stood together at the land side door, and watched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
for him. A sudden silence fell between them, they
stopped wondering about his delay, and kept their
eyes on the road. The time seemed to stand still.
Margot went into the house and sat down. Christine&#8217;s
life seemed to be in her eyes. Every minute
was like an hour. &#8220;Feyther, Feyther!&#8221; she said in
an anxious whisper. &#8220;Whatna for are you delaying?
What at all is keeping you? Come, Feyther!&#8221; And
to this strong cry of the Inner Woman, he turned a
corner, and was in full view.</p>
<p>Christine saw in a moment that something was
wrong. &#8220;He isna walking like himsel&#8217;! He must
hae got hurt some way or ither!&#8221; and she ran like
a deer to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feyther! Feyther! Whatever&#8217;s ailing you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood still and looked at her, and she was
shocked at his appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you hurt yoursel&#8217;, Feyther?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has hurt me. I hae taken a sair cold
and shivering. I am ill, lassie. I maun hae a doctor
as soon as maybe. I am in a hot and cauld misery.
I can hardly draw a breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margot met them at the door. &#8220;Feyther is ill,
Mither! Where&#8217;s Jamie? He will run and tell the
Domine. Get feyther into his bed, and if I canna
find Jamie, I&#8217;ll away mysel&#8217; for the Domine. Perhaps
I had better go to the town for Doctor Fraser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feyther says no! He wants to see the Domine,
particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll waste no time seeking Jamie. I&#8217;ll go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
mysel&#8217; to the manse, and I&#8217;ll be back as quick as possible.
Keep a brave heart, Mither. There&#8217;s only
you, till I get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Happily she found the Domine more than halfway
on his road to Ruleson&#8217;s. He said he had had
a feeling an hour ago, that he was wanted there, and
he was angry with himself for not obeying the word
given him. Then he took Christine&#8217;s hand, and they
went hurriedly and in silence to the sick man.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend! My dear friend!&#8221; he said as he
clasped Ruleson&#8217;s hot hand and listened to his labored
breathing, &#8220;I am going as fast as I can for
Fraser. This is a trouble beyond my skill, and we
want you well for the Easter school exercises. The
bairns willna be happy missing you. So I&#8217;ll go quick
as I can for <ins title='Added quote'>Fraser.&#8221;</ins> Then turning to Margot, he
said, &#8220;Where is Faith Anderson? I thought she was
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is, but she went to the village to see some o&#8217;
her auld friends. She said she would be back by
nine o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Jamie? He could go wi&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith took Jamie wi&#8217; her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went away, and Margot and Christine
stood helplessly beside the suffering man. It grew
dark, and no one came, and Christine felt as if she
was in some dreadful dream, and could not awaken
herself. They expected Norman about seven, but
something detained him, and it was after nine when
Faith and Jamie were heard on the hill. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
laughing and talking noisily, and Christine ran to
meet, and to silence them. The sick man was growing
rapidly worse, and there was no sign of the
Domine and the doctor. Indeed it was near midnight
when they arrived, and by this time Ruleson
was unconscious.</p>
<p>Those who know anything of pneumonia will understand
the hard, cruel fight that a man in the perfect
health and strength of James Ruleson made for
his life. Every step of the disease was contested,
and it was only when his wonderful resistance gave
out, and his strength failed him, that the doctor and
the Domine lost hope. At length, one sunny afternoon,
the Domine drew up the window shade, and
let the light fall on the still, white face for a minute.
Christine was at his side, and he turned to her,
and said, &#8220;I am going back to the manse for the
Blessed Cup of Remembrance. Get the table and
bread ready, and tell your mother it is the last time!
She must try and eat it with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christine looked at him with her soul in her eyes.
She understood all he meant and she merely bowed
her head and turned to the dying man. He lay as
still as a cradled child. The struggle was over. He
had given it up. It was peace at last. Where was
James Ruleson at that hour? The Domine had said,
&#8220;Do not disturb him. We know not what now is
passing in his soul. Let him learn in peace whatever
God wishes him to learn, in this pause between one
life and another.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>Margot was on her bed in another room. Christine
knelt down at her side, and said gently, &#8220;Mither,
the great, wonderful hour has come. The Domine
has gane for The Cup. With your ain dear hands
you will spread the cloth, and cut the bread, for your
last eating wi&#8217; him. And, Mither, you won&#8217;t cry
out, and weep, as those do who have nae hope o&#8217;
meeting again. You will mak&#8217; yoursel&#8217; do as the
daughters o&#8217; God do, who call Him &#8216;Feyther&#8217;!
You&#8217;ll be strong in the Lord, Mither, and bid Feyther
&#8216;good-by,&#8217; like those who are sure they will meet
to part no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Margot whispered, &#8220;I was brought low, and
He helped me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few hours later, in this simple cottage bedroom,
the miracle of Love&#8217;s last supper in the upper chamber
at Jerusalem, was remembered. With her own
hands Margot covered a little table at her husband&#8217;s
bedside with her finest and whitest linen. She cut the
bread into the significant morsels, and when the
Domine came, he placed them solemnly on the silver
plate of the consecrated service, and poured wine
into the holy vessel of The Communion. All was
then ready, and they sat down to wait for that lightening
which so often comes when the struggle is over
and the end near.</p>
<p>They waited long. Ruleson&#8217;s deep sleep lasted
for hours, and the Domine began to hope it might
be that life-giving sleep which often introduces the
apparently dying to a new lease of life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>He awoke after midnight, with the word &#8220;Margot&#8221;
on his lips, and Margot slipped her hand into
his, and kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to have supper with the Lord
Christ. Will you join us, Ruleson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, will&mdash;I&mdash;gladly!&#8221;</p>
<p>After the simple rite Ruleson was quite happy.
He said a few words privately to the Domine, asked
for his grandson, and told him to be a good man,
and a minister of God, and promised if it was in
God&#8217;s will he would watch o&#8217;er him, and then blessed
and sent him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might hae another struggle at the last. I dinna
want him to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The struggle is over, James,&#8221; answered the
Domine. &#8220;Be still, and wait for the salvation of
the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for some hours, even until the day broke, and
the shadows began to flee away, that dying room was
in a strange peace. Margot and Christine sat almost
motionless, watching their loved one&#8217;s face
growing more and more calm and content, and the
Domine stood or sat at the foot of the bed, and all
was intensely still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great things are passing in the soul now,&#8221; he
said to the women. &#8220;It is contemplating the past.
It is judging itself. It is bearing witness to the
righteousness and mercy of its Maker. Pray that it
may come from this great assize justified through
Christ.&#8221; Soon after, he added &#8220;The tide has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
turned, he will go out with the tide. Stand near him
now, and sing softly with me his last human prayer:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Jesus, lover of my soul,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Let me to thy bosom fly;</p>
<p>While the nearer waters roll,</p>
<p class='indent2'>While the tempest still is nigh:</p>
<p>Hide me, oh my Saviour, hide!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Till the storm of life is past,</p>
<p>Safe into the haven guide,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Oh receive my soul at last!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Once the dying man opened his eyes, once he
smiled, but ere the last line was finished, James Ruleson
had</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Gone on that long voyage all men take,</p>
<p>And with angelic help, had once again,</p>
<p>By unknown waters, entered a new world.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Time waits neither for the living nor the dead, and
when a month had come and gone, Margot and
Christine had accepted, in some measure, their inevitable
condition. Ruleson had left his small affairs
beyond all dispute. His cottage was bequeathed
entirely to his wife and daughter, &#8220;for all
the days of their lives.&#8221; His boat was to be sold,
and the proceeds given to his widow. The two hundred
cash he had in the bank was also Margot&#8217;s,
and the few acres of land he owned he gave to his
eldest son, Norman, who had stood faithfully by his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
side through all his good and evil days. No one was
dissatisfied except Norman&#8217;s wife, who said her man,
being the eldest born, had a full right to house and
cash, and a&#8217; there was, saving Margot&#8217;s lawful
widow right. She said this so often that she positively
convinced herself of its rightness and justice,
&#8220;and some day,&#8221; she frequently added, &#8220;I will let
Mistress and Miss Ruleson know the ground on
which they stand.&#8221; To Norman, she was more explicit
and denunciatory&mdash;and he let her talk.</p>
<p>It had been very positively stated in the adoption
of James Ruleson, the younger, that the simple decease
of his grandfather made him the adopted son
of the Domine, and it was thought best to carry out
this provision without delay. Margot had been seriously
ill after the funeral, and she said calmly now,
that she was only waiting until her change came. But
life still struggled bravely within her for its promised
length, and the Domine said Death would have
to take her at unawares, if he succeeded yet awhile.
This was the truth. The desire to live was still
strong in Margot&#8217;s heart, she really wished earnestly
to live out all her days.</p>
<p>Now, public sympathy soon wears out. The village
which had gone <i>en masse</i> to weep at James
Ruleson&#8217;s funeral, had in two weeks chosen Peter
Brodie to fill his place. The women who were now
busy with their spring cleaning, and their preparations
for the coming herring season, could not afford
to weep any longer with &#8220;thae set-up Rulesons.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Neil had ignored all of them at the funeral, Margot&#8217;s
sorrow they judged to be &#8220;a vera dry manifestation,&#8221;
and Christine would not talk about her
father&#8217;s last hours. The women generally disapproved
of a grief that was so dry-eyed and silent.</p>
<p>So gradually the little house on the hill became
very solitary. Jamie ran up from the school at the
noon hour, and sometimes he stayed an hour or two
with them after the school was closed. Then the
Domine came for him, and they all had tea together.
But as the evening twilight lengthened, the games in
the playground lengthened, and the Domine encouraged
the lad in all physical exercises likely to increase
his stature and his strength.</p>
<p>Then the herring season came, and the Rulesons
had nothing to do with it, and so they gradually lost
their long preëminence. Everyone was busy from
early to late with his own affairs. And the Rulesons?
&#8220;Had they not their gentleman son, Neil? And
their four lads wearing the Henderson uniform?
And the Domine? And the lad Cluny Macpherson?
Did he care for any human creature but Christine
Ruleson?&#8221;</p>
<p>With these sentiments influencing the village society,
it was no wonder that Margot complained that
her friends had deserted her. She had been the
leader of the village women in their protective and
social societies, and there was no doubt she had
been authoritative, and even at times tyrannical. But
Margot did not believe she had ever gone too far.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
She was sure that her leniency and consideration
were her great failing.</p>
<p>So the winter came again, and Christine looked
exceedingly weary. While Ruleson lived, Margot
had relied on him, she was sure that he would be
sufficient, but after his death, she encouraged an unreasonable
trial of various highly reputed physicians.
They came to her from Edinburgh and Aberdeen,
and she believed that every fresh physician was the
right one. The expense of this method was far
beyond the profit obtained. Yet Christine could not
bear to make any protest.</p>
<p>And the weeks went on, and there appeared to be
neither profit nor pleasure in them. The Domine
watched Christine with wonder, and in the second
year of her vigil, with great anxiety. &#8220;Christine will
break down soon, Margot,&#8221; he said one day to the
sick woman. &#8220;Look at the black shadows under her
eyes. And her eyes are losing all their beauty, her
figure droops, and her walk lags and stumbles.
Could you not do with Faith for a few days, and let
Christine get away for a change? You&#8217;ll hae a sick
daughter, if you don&#8217;t do something, and that soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna stand Faith Anderson. She&#8217;s o&#8217;er set up
wi&#8217; hersel&#8217;. I am that full o&#8217; pain and sorrow that
Faith&#8217;s bouncing happiness is a parfect blow in a
body&#8217;s face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The schoolmaster&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no a bairn, Domine; and she treats auld and
young as if they were bairns. She would want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
to teach me my alphabet, and my catechism o&#8217;er
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Nannie Brodie. She is a gentle little
thing. She will do all Christine does for a few
shillings a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of, Domine? I couldna
afford a few shillings a week. I hae wonderfu&#8217; expenses
wi&#8217; doctors and medicines, and my purse feels
gey light in my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, Margot, that my advice will come to little.
Yet consider, Margot, if Christine falls sick, who
will nurse her? And what will become o&#8217; yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>He went away with the words, and he found
Christine sitting on the doorstep, watching the sea,
as she used to watch it for her father&#8217;s boat. She
looked tired, but she smiled brightly when he called
her name.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear lassie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you ought to have
some new thoughts, since you are not likely to get
new scenes. Have you any nice books to read?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Mither stopped <i>Chambers Magazine</i>
and <i>The Scotsman</i>, and I ken a&#8217; the books we hae,
as if they were school books. Some o&#8217; them are
Neil&#8217;s old readers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear, lonely lassie! This day I will send
you some grand novels, and some books of travel.
Try and lose yourself and your weariness in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Sir! If you would do this, I can bear everything!
I can do everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go home this hour, and the books will be here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
before dark. Get as much fresh air as you can,
and fill your mind with fresh pictures, and fresh
ideas, and I wouldn&#8217;t wonder if you win back your
spirits, and your beauty. Your mother is a great
care, lassie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Doctor, but she is in God&#8217;s care. I hae
naething to do but help and pleasure her, when she&#8217;s
waking. She sleeps much o&#8217; her time now. I think
the medicine o&#8217; the last doctor frae Aberdeen, is the
because o&#8217; her sleepiness. I was going to ask you
to take a look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did so, and said in reply, &#8220;There&#8217;s no harm
in it, but it would be well enough to give it with a
double portion of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Domine went away, and Christine did
not know that this hour was really the turning point
of her life. And it is perhaps well for the majority
that this important crisis is seldom recognized on its
arrival. There might be interferences, and blunderings
of all kinds. But a destiny that is not realized,
or meddled with, goes without let or hindrance to its
appointed end.</p>
<p>Christine rose with a new strength in her heart
and went to her mother. &#8220;Come here, dear lass,&#8221;
said Margot. &#8220;The Domine was telling me thou
art sick wi&#8217; the nursing o&#8217; me, and that thou must hae
a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine had no right to say such a thing.
I am quite well, Mither. I should be sick, if I was
one mile from you. I have no work and no pleasure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
away from your side, dear, dear Mither! I am
sorry the Domine judged me sae hardly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine is an interfering auld man. He is
getting outside his pulpit. When I was saying I
missed wee Jamie, and I wished him to come mair
often to see me, you should hae watched him bridle
up. &#8216;James must be more under control,&#8217; he said,
in a vera pompous manner. I answered, &#8216;The laddie
is quite biddable, Doctor,&#8217; and he said, &#8216;Mistress,
that belongs to his years. He is yet under authority,
and I cannot allow him too much freedom.&#8217; And the
bairn is my ain! My ain grandchild! Too much
freedom wi&#8217; his sick grandmother! Heard ye ever
the like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Mither, he was right in a way. Jamie has
been a bit stiff-necked and self-willed lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isna a thing wrang wi&#8217; the laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, he behaves better wi&#8217; you than wi&#8217; any
other person. The Domine is making a fine lad o&#8217;
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a&#8217; that, before the Domine kent him at
a&#8217;. I wasna carin&#8217; for the reverend this afternoon.
I dinna wonder the village women are saying he has
his fingers in everyone&#8217;s pie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for everyone&#8217;s good, Mither, if it be true;
but you ken fine how little the village say-so can be
trusted; and less now, than ever; for since you arena
able to sort their clashes, they say what they like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nae doubt o&#8217; it, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine promised to send me some books to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
read. You see, Mither, the pain you hae wearies
you sae that you sleep a great deal, and I am glad o&#8217;
it, for the sleep builds up what the pain pulls down,
so that you hold up your ain side better than might
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a plain truth, dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then when you sleep, I am lonely, and I get to
thinking and worrying anent this and that, and so I
look tired when there&#8217;s naething wrang. But if I
had books to read, when I hadna yoursel&#8217; to talk
wi&#8217;, I would be gey happy, and maybe full o&#8217; wonderfuls
to tell you as you lie wakin&#8217; and wearyful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a maybe, and you hae to give maybes a
trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Mither, we gave up our <i>Chambers
Magazine</i> and <i>The Scotsman</i> when Feyther left us
alane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was right to do sae; there was sae many expenses,
what wi&#8217; the burying, and wi&#8217; my sickness,
the last item being a constant outgo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must hae the medicines, and we be to gie
up all expenses, if so be it was needed for that
end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, if I was to stay here, and be a troubler
much langer, that might be needed, but I hae a few
pounds left yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will never be needed. The children o&#8217; the
righteous hae a sure claim on the God o&#8217; the
righteous, and He is bound and ready to answer it.
Those were almost the last words Feyther said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
me. I was wearying for books, and you see, He has
sent them to me, without plack or bawbee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, lassie, if books will mak&#8217; you happy, I
am glad they are coming to you. Whiles you can
read a short story out o&#8217; <i>Chambers</i> to mysel&#8217;. I
used to like thae little love tales, when you read one
sometimes to us by the fireside. Anyway, they were
mair sensible than the village clash-ma-clavers; maist
o&#8217; which are black, burning lees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mither, we&#8217;ll hae many a happy hour yet,
wi&#8217; the tales I shall read to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nae doubt o&#8217; it. They&#8217;ll all o&#8217; them be lees&mdash;made
up lees&mdash;but the lees won&#8217;t be anent folks we
ken, and think weel of, or anent oursel&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be anent anybody, Mither. The men
who write the stories make up the men and women,
and then make up the things they set them to do, and
to say. It is all make-believe, ye ken, but many a
good lesson is learned by good stories. They can
teach, as well as sermons. Folks that won&#8217;t go and
hear a sermon will maybe read a good story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wadna daur to read them in a kirk, for they
arena the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, there are many other things you wouldna
care to read in the kirk&mdash;a perfectly honest love letter,
for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you hear frae Cluny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday. He is kept vera close to his business,
and he is studying navigation, so that helps him
to get the long hours in foreign ports over. He&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
hoping to get a step higher at the New Year, and
to be transferred to the Atlantic boats. Then he can
perhaps get awa&#8217; a little oftener. Mither, I was
thinking when you got strong enough, we might
move to Glasgow. You would hae a&#8217; your lads, but
Norman, mair at your hand then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but Norman is worth a&#8217; the lave o&#8217; them,
and beside if I left this dear auld hame, Norman
would want to come here, and I couldna thole the
thought o&#8217; that ill luck. Yet it would be gey hard
to refuse him, if he asked me, and harder still to
think night and day o&#8217; his big, blundering, rough
lads, among my flower beds, and destroying everything
in baith house and bounds. I couldna think o&#8217;
it! Your feyther brought me here when the house
was naething at a&#8217; but a but and a ben. A bed and
a table, a few chairs, and a handfu&#8217; o&#8217; crockery was
a&#8217; we had in the wide warld&mdash;save and forbye, as I
hae often told you, my gold wedding ring.&#8221; And
Margot held up her white, shrunken hand, and
looked at it with tears streaming down her face. And
oh, how tenderly Christine kissed her hand and her
face, and said she was right, and she did not wonder
she feared Norman&#8217;s boys. They were a rough-and-tumble
lot, but would make fine men, every one
o&#8217; them being born for the sea, and the fishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sae, Christine. They&#8217;ll do fine in a fishing
boat, among nets and sails. But here! Nay, nay!
And then there&#8217;s the mither o&#8217; them! That woman
in my place! Can you think o&#8217; it, lassie?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never speak again o&#8217; the matter. I ken
how you feel, Mither. It would be too cruel! it
would be mair than you could bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was a man&#8217;s voice heard in the living
room, and Christine went to answer the call. It was
the Domine&#8217;s messenger, with his arms full of books.
And Christine had them taken into her mother&#8217;s
room, and for a whole hour sat beside her and
showed her books full of pictures, and read short
anecdotes from the magazine volume, and Margot
for a while seemed interested, but finally said with
an air of great weariness: &#8220;Tak&#8217; them all awa&#8217;,
dearie. Ye can hae the best bedroom for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mither, will you let me hae the use o&#8217; it?
I will keep a&#8217; in order, and it is sae near to yoursel&#8217;,
I could hear you if you only spoke my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tak&#8217; the room and welcome. Neil had it for
many a year. It has a feeling o&#8217; books and lesson-larning
in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that night, when her mother was in her first
sleep, Christine took her books into this large, silent
room. It faced the sea. It had an atmosphere different
from that of any other room in the house, and
no one but herself was likely to enter it. There was
a broad sill to the largest window, and Christine
arranged the Domine&#8217;s books on it. In the dozen or
more volumes there was a pleasant variety&mdash;history,
poetry and the popular novels of the time&mdash;especially
the best work of George Eliot, Miss Braddon,
Thackeray, and Dickens.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>It was all so wonderful to Christine, she could
hardly believe it. She touched them lovingly, she
could have kissed them. For in those days in Scotland,
good literature was yet a sort of luxury. A
person in a country place who had a good novel, and
was willing to loan it, was a benefactor. Christine
had borrowed from the schoolmaster&#8217;s wife all she
had to lend, and for several weeks had been without
mental food and mental outlook. Was there any
wonder that she was depressed and weary-looking?</p>
<p>Now all quickly changed. The housework went
with her as if it were paid to do so. She sang as she
worked. She was running in and out of Mither&#8217;s
room with unfailing cheerfulness, and Margot
caught her happy tone, and they were sufficient for
each other. Mother and books would have been
sufficient alone, but they had also many outside ties
and interests. The Domine allowed Jamie to go to
grandmother&#8217;s once a day. There were Cluny and
Neil, and all the rest of the boys, the Domine and
the villagers, the kirk and the school; and always
Jamie came in the afternoon, and brought with him
the daily <i>Glasgow Herald</i>. It was the Domine&#8217;s
way. At first he had not consciously recognized what
Christine required, but as soon as the situation was
evident to him, he hasted to perform the good work,
and he did the duty liberally, and wearied not in it.</p>
<p>So the days came and went, and neither Margot
nor Christine counted them, and Cluny came whenever
he could by any travel get a few hours with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Christine. And the herring season came and went
again, and was not very successful. Margot and
Christine were sorry, but it was no longer a matter
of supreme importance. Still, the gossip concerning
the fishing always interested Margot, and someone
generally brought it to her. If no one did, she
frankly asked the Domine what was going on, for he
always knew everything affecting the people who sat
in Culraine Kirk of Scotland.</p>
<p>Certainly he watched Christine&#8217;s improvement
with the greatest interest and pleasure. In six
months she was a far more beautiful woman than
she had ever before been. Her soul was developing
on the finest lines, and it was constantly beautifying
its fleshly abode. The work was like that of a
lapidary who, day by day, cuts and polishes a gem
of great value. Even Margot occasionally looked
intently at her daughter, and said wonderingly, &#8220;You
are growing very bonnie, Christine, the Domine
must hae lost his sight, when he thought you were
sick and wearying for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never sick, Mither. Whiles, when I was
worrying mysel&#8217; anent Angus Ballister, I used to hae
a dowie weariness come o&#8217;er me; but since feyther
went awa&#8217; I havena had as much as a headache.
Now if it suits you, Mither, I&#8217;ll gie you your knitting,
I&#8217;m wanting to go and write down something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, gie me the needles, and gie my love to
Cluny, and tell him to bring me ane o&#8217; them white
fuchsia plants he saw in a Glasgow window.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hae given that word already, Mither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it again, lassie. Any man bides twice telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the writing Christine wished to do was not a
letter to her lover. It was some lines that had been
running through her mind for an hour, and she knew
that the only way in which she could lay their persistency,
was to write them down. She had just finished
this work, when the door was opened, and the
Domine came in, with a gust of wind, that blew the
paper on which she was writing across the room. He
caught it first, and he smiled when he saw it was
poetry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll even read it, Christine, it might be worth
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldna help writing the lines down, Sir. They
bothered me till I did sae. They always do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-h! Then the lines are your own. That is a
circumstance I cannot pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gie them to me, Sir. Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I have read them, Christine,&#8221; and immediately
he proceeded to read them aloud. He read
them twice, the second time with care and sympathy:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The boats rocked idly on the bay,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The nets hung straight within the deep,</p>

<p>Why should they care, and watch, and wake&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent2'>Nets of the sleeping fishers take.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>

<p>Yes, Thou wouldst speak of boats and nets,</p>

</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Sir, will you give me the bit paper now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to give it to me. In a year I should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
like to read it again, and see how you have improved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your will wi&#8217; it, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To write poetry teaches you how to write prose&mdash;teaches
you the words of the English language,
their variety and value. A good prose writer can
write poetry, for he is acquainted wi&#8217; words, and can
always find the word he wants; but a good poet is
not often a good prose writer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that, Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is satisfied with his own vehicle of
expression. He thinks it is the best. I am glad you
have begun by writing poetry&mdash;but do not stop
there.&#8221; As he was speaking he folded up the bit of
paper in his hand, and put it into his pocketbook.
Then he went to speak to Margot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what do you think? Christine
has been writing a poem, and it is better than
might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine has been making up poetry ever since
she was a bit bairn. She reads a great deal o&#8217; poetry
to me out o&#8217; the books you sent her. Oh, Domine,
they hae been a wonderfu&#8217; pleasuring to us baith!
Though I never thought I wad live to find my only
pleasure in novels and bits o&#8217; poetry. Three or four
years ago I wad hae laughed anyone to scorn who
said such a thing could happen to Margot Ruleson.
&#8217;Deed wad I!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God often brings the impossible to pass, and
even nourishes us on it. What has Christine been
reading to you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She has read to me the doings o&#8217; David Copperfield,
and about that puir lad, Oliver Twist. I was
greatly ta&#8217;en up wi&#8217; the lads. I maist forgot mysel&#8217;,
listening to their troubles and adventures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Margot. What is she reading to you
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A book by a Mr. Thackeray. His picture is in
the book. It&#8217;s what they ca&#8217; a frontispiece. He has
a big head, and he isna handsome, but he looks like
he could mak&#8217; up a good story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the book called &#8216;Vanity Fair&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very name. I dinna see yet the meaning
o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, I like the folks best that I shouldna like.
There&#8217;s an auld woman in it, that I wad gie a cup
o&#8217; tea and an hour&#8217;s crack to, any day, and be glad
o&#8217; the pleasure o&#8217; it; and there&#8217;s the girl, called
Becky, that isna at a&#8217; a kirklike girl, but I canna help
liking her weel. I think I wad hae been her marrow,
if I had been born and brought up as she was. I&#8217;m
sure it must be gey hard for men to mak&#8217; up the likeness
o&#8217; a real good woman&mdash;they mak&#8217; them too
good, you feel as if they should be in heaven, and
mostly I find they send them there by early death,
or some other disease, or mischance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you like Becky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. There&#8217;s circumstances, Sir! They alter
cases. They do that! If a woman has the fight wi&#8217;
the warld on her hands, she&#8217;ll be requiring a little o&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
the deil in her, just to keep the deil out o&#8217; her. I
hope the man Thackeray has had sense enou&#8217; to mak&#8217;
Becky come a&#8217; right at the lang end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she becomes very respectable, and joins
the Church of England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be the right thing for her. I hae
heard that it is a vera broad church, and that its
deacons&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wardens, Margot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wardens be it. I hae heard that they dinna dog
its members round Sunday and work days, as our
deacons do. Your ain deacons are vera officious, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elder James Ruleson, while he lived, saw that
every kirk officer did his duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Domine! It is good to hear his
name. Everyone seems to have forgotten him&mdash;everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not forgotten, Margot. His name is on
nearly every page o&#8217; the kirk books, and the school
will keep his memory green. I am going to propose
a Ruleson Day, and on it give all the children a holiday.
Weel, Margot, here comes Christine, and I
believe she has Becky in hand.&#8221; Then he turned to
Christine and said, &#8220;You have taken steps on a fair
road, go straight forward.&#8221; And she smiled, and
her smile was like sunshine, and the Domine felt
the better for it. He lifted his head higher, and
took longer steps, and walked home with a new and
pleasant hope in his heart.</p>

</div></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Nearly</span> two years had passed since James
Ruleson&#8217;s death, and Christine was facing an
embarrassing condition. She was nearly
without money. During the severe illness which
followed her husband&#8217;s death, Margot had entrusted
all she had to Christine, except the sum she
had retained for her own burial; and Christine knew
this was a provision all Culraine women regarded as
a sacred duty. To break into this sum would be a
serious, perhaps a dangerous, trial to Margot. However,
there was the ninety pounds that Neil had borrowed
from her, and never repaid. Now she must
apply for it, must indeed urge its immediate return,
and she wrote her brother the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Neil,</span></p>
<p>We are in a sair strait. I am nearly without money, and
Mither has none left but her burial siller, and you know it
will nearly kill her to break into that. I would not ask you
to pay me the ninety pounds you owe me, if there was any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
other way I could do. I would go out and sell fish, before I
would trouble you. But surely it will not be hurting you
any way now, to pay ninety pounds. Jim Carnagie was
telling me that you were doing a well-paying business.
Dear Neil, it is for your mither! She pleaded for you to
have your own will and wish all your life long. I need
not remind you of all her thoughtfulness for your comfort,
while you were at the Maraschal. She is dying, a cruel,
hard, long death. I cannot, no, I cannot, trouble her last
days anent the siller she needs for food to keep her in life,
and for medicines to soothe her great pain. Neil, I have
always loved and helped you. I was glad when Miss Rath
took to you kindly, for I knew you had to have some woman
to look after your special ways and likings. Tell her the
truth, and I am sure she will not oppose your paying such
a just debt. Neil, answer me at once. Do not think about
it, and delay and delay. You know, dear Neil, it is getting
on the fourth year, since I loaned you it, and you promised
to pay me out of the first money you earned. I think, dear,
you will now pay me as lovingly as I let you have it when
you needed it so badly.</p>
<p>Mither does not know I am writing you, or even that
we need money, so haste to make me more easy, for I am
full of trouble and anxiety.</p>
<p class='sig1'>Your loving sister,</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Christine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter had a singular fate. It was left at
Neil&#8217;s house five minutes after Neil had left his
house for a journey to London, on some important
business for the Western Bank. It was consequently
given to Mrs. Ruleson. She looked at it curiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
It was a woman&#8217;s writing, and the writing was familiar
to her. The half-obliterated post office stamp
assured her. It was from Neil&#8217;s home, and there
was the word &#8220;Haste&#8221; on the address, so there was
probably trouble there. With some hesitation she
opened and read it, read slowly and carefully, every
word of it, and when she had done so, flung it from
her in passionate contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lying, thieving, contemptible creature,&#8221; she
said, in a low, intense voice. &#8220;I gave him ninety
pounds, when his father died. He told me then some
weird story about this money. And I believed him.
I, Roberta Rath, believed him! I am ashamed of
myself! Reginald told me long syne that he knew
the little villain was making a private hoard for
himself, and that the most o&#8217; his earnings went to
it. I will look into that business next. Reggie told
me I would come to it. I cannot think of it now,
my first care must be this poor, anxious girl, and her
dying mother. I believe I will go to Culraine and
see them! He has always found out a reason for
me not going. I will just show him I am capable
of taking my own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reflected on this decision for a few moments,
and then began to carry it out with a smiling hurry.
She made arrangements with her cook for the carrying
on of the household for her calculated absence
of three days. Then she dressed herself with becoming
fashion and fitness, and in less than an hour,
had visited the Bank of Scotland, and reached the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
railway station. Of course she went first to Edinburgh,
and she lingered a little there, in the fur
shops. She selected a pretty neck piece and muff
of Russian sable, and missed a train, and so it was
dark, and too late when she reached the town to go
to the village of Culraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always my way,&#8221; she murmured, as she sat
over her lonely cup of tea in her hotel parlor. &#8220;I
am so long in choosing what I want, that I lose my
luck. I wonder now if I have really got the best
and the bonniest. Poor father, he was aye looking
for a woman to be a mother to me, and never found
one good enough. I was well in my twenties before
I could decide on a husband; and I am pretty sure
I waited too long. Three women bought furs while
I was swithering about mine. It is just possible to
be too careful. Liking may be better than consideration.
Johnny Lockhart told me if I would trust my
heart, instead of my brain, I would make better decisions.
It might be so. Who can tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning, when she had finished her breakfast,
she went to the window of her room and looked
into the street. Several Culraine fishing-women were
calling their fresh haddock and flounders, and she
looked at them critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are young and handsome,&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;but their dress is neither fashionable, nor becoming.
I should think it was a trial for a pretty girl to wear
it&mdash;too short petticoats&mdash;stripes too yellow and wide&mdash;too
much color every way&mdash;earrings quite out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
fashion&mdash;caps picturesque, but very trying, and a
sailor hat would be less trouble and more attractive.
Well, as the fisherwomen are crying fresh haddock,
I should think I may call on Christine, and not break
any social law of the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christine was not now a very early riser. If Margot
had a restless, bad night, both of them often fell
asleep at the dawning, and it had occasionally been
as late as eight o&#8217;clock when their breakfast was
over. Roberta Rath&#8217;s visit happened to fall on one
of these belated mornings. It was nearly nine
o&#8217;clock, but Margot had just had her breakfast, and
was washed and dressed, and sitting in a big chair by
the fireside of her room.</p>
<p>Christine was standing by a table in the living
room. There was a large pan of hot water before
her, and she was going to wash the breakfast dishes.
Then there was a soft, quick knock at the door, and
she called a little peremptorily, &#8220;Come in.&#8221; She
thought it was some girl from the school, who
wanted to borrow a necklace or some bit of finery
for an expected dance. And it is not always that
the most obliging of women are delighted to lend
their ornaments.</p>
<p>When Roberta answered her curt invitation, she
was amazed. She did not know her, she had never
seen Roberta, nor even a likeness of her, for there
were no photographs then, and the daguerreotype
was expensive and not yet in common request. She
looked with wide-open eyes at the lady, and the lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
smiled. And her smile was entrancing, for she
seemed to smile from head to feet. Then she advanced
and held out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Roberta,&#8221; she said. And Christine laid
down her cup and towel, and answered with eager
pleasure, &#8220;You are vera welcome, Roberta. I am
Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! I know that. You are exactly the
Christine I have dreamed about,&#8221; and she lifted up
her small face, and Christine kissed her, before she
was aware. It was the most extraordinary thing,
and Christine blushed and burned, but yet was
strangely pleased and satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I stay with you till four this afternoon,
Christine? I want to very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be mair than welcome. Mither will be
beside hersel&#8217; wi&#8217; the visit. Is Neil wi&#8217; you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I have come of my own wish and will. Neil
is in London. Let me speak to the man who drove
me here, and then I will tell you how it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left the house for a few minutes, and came
back with a beaming face, and a parcel in her hand.
&#8220;Suppose, Christine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you show me where
I can take off my bonnet and cloak and furs.&#8221; So
Christine went with her to the best bedroom, and
she cried out at the beauty of its view, and looked
round at the books and papers, and the snow-white
bed, and was wonder struck at the great tropic sea
shell, hanging before the south window; for its wide
rose-pink cavity was holding a fine plant of musk-flower,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
and its hanging sprays of bloom, and heavenly
scent, enthralled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a charming room!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;One could
dream of heaven in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you dream, Roberta?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like to dream?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not like to go to bed, and not dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you feel that way. Some people cannot
dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor things! Neil could not understand me
about dreaming. Nor could I explain it to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawyers don&#8217;t dream. I have heard that. I
suppose the folk in the other warld canna fash themselves
wi&#8217; the quarreling o&#8217; this warld.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roberta was untying the parcel containing the
furs, as Christine spoke, and her answer was to put
the long boa of sable around Christine&#8217;s neck and
place the muff in her right hand. Now, good fur
suits everyone&mdash;man or woman&mdash;and Christine was
regally transformed by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Roberta!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What bonnie furs!
I never saw the like o&#8217; them! Never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now they are yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dinna&mdash;you canna mean, that you gie them
to me, Roberta?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely do mean just that. I give them to you
with all my heart and you look like a Norse princess
in them. Come, give me a kiss for the boa, and a
kiss for the muff, and we will call the gift square.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>Then Roberta kissed Christine and they laughed
a sweet, gay little laugh together. And Christine
said, &#8220;I hae always wanted a sister. Now I hae
gotten one weel to my liking! And O, the bonnie
furs! The bonnie furs! They suit me fine, Roberta!
They suit me fine!&#8221; and she smiled at herself
in the little mirror, and was happy, beyond expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are as happy as if you had found a fortune,
Christine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae found mair than a fortune, Roberta! I
hae found a sister! I wasna looking for such good
luck to come to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way good luck comes&mdash;always as a
surprise. We watch for it on the main road, and it
just slips round a corner.&#8221; Then Roberta took
Christine by the hand, and they went to the living-room,
and Christine began to wash her teacups, and
as she laid them dripping on the tray, Roberta took
the towel and wiped them dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldna do that, Roberta.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isna wark for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While Father lived, I always washed the china
beside him. Then he read the newspaper, and we
had happy talks. We were plain-living folk, until
Father died. Then Reggie and I set up for quality.
We had the money, and Reggie had quality friends,
and I thought it would be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it is fine?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is no better than it is spoken of. Christine,
can you guess what brought me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get a letter I wrote Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I know why you came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil had just left for London. You asked for no
delay. So I brought the money, Christine, and I had
the Bank calculate the proper amount of interest for
four years, at five per cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no interest asked. There is none
due. I didna lend a&#8217; the money I had on interest,
but on love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then here is the money, Christine, and I must
thank you for Neil, for the long credit you have
given him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I havena been needing the siller until now, but
now it is a real salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christine put the money in her breast, and then together
they put the cleansed china in its proper place.
Just as they finished this duty, a little handbell
tinkled, and Christine said,</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Mither&#8217;s call. Let us go to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mither, dear Roberta is here. She has come to
see you.&#8221; And the young woman stood looking into
the old woman&#8217;s face, and in a moment something
inarticulate passed between them. They smiled at
each other, and Roberta stooped and kissed the
white, worn face. There needed no further explanation.
In a few minutes the three women were conversing
in the most intimate and cheerful manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
To her mother, Christine appeared to be rather
silent. Margot wished she would be more effusive,
and she exerted herself to make up for Christine&#8217;s
deficiency in this respect. But the release from great
anxiety often leaves the most thankful heart apparently
quiet, and apparently indifferent. Many
who have prayed fervently for help, when the help
comes have no words on their tongues to speak
their gratitude. Flesh and spirit are exhausted,
before the Deliverer they are speechless. Then
He who knoweth our infirmities speaks for
us.</p>
<p>To make what dinner she could, and put the house
in order was then Christine&#8217;s duty, and she went
about it, leaving Roberta with Margot. They soon
became quite at ease with each other, and Christine
could hear them laughing at their own conversation.
After awhile they were very quiet, and Christine
wondered if her mother had again become sleepy.
On the contrary, she found Margot more alive and
more interested than she had seen her since her husband&#8217;s
death.</p>
<p>There was a crochet needle between them, and
they were both absorbed in what it was doing.
Crochet was then a new thing on the earth, as far as
England and Scotland was concerned; and at this
date it was the reigning womanly fad. Margot had
seen and dreamed over such patterns of it as had
got into magazines and newspapers, but had never
seen the work itself. Now Roberta was teaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
her its easy stitches, and Margot, with all a child&#8217;s
enthusiasm, was learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Christine,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Look, Christine,
at the bonnie wark I am learning! It is the crochet
wark. We hae read about it, ye ken, but see for
yoursel&#8217;. Look, lassie,&#8221; and she proudly held out a
strip of the first simple edging.</p>
<p>The three women then sat down together, and
there was wonder and delight among them. A bit
of fine, delicate crochet now gets little notice, but
then it was a new sensation, and women thought they
lacked an important source of pleasure, if they went
anywhere without the little silk bag holding their
crochet materials. Roberta had crocheted in the
train, as long as it was light, and she fully intended
to crochet all day, as she sat talking to her new relations.</p>
<p>Margot could knit blindfolded, she learned by
some native and natural instinct. In two days she
would have been able to teach Roberta.</p>
<p>There was a simple dinner of baked fish, and a
cup of tea, and Christine beat an egg in a cup and
was going to carry it to Margot, when Roberta
stayed her. &#8220;Does she like it in that sloppy way?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, it is for her good. She has to like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can make it far nicer. See here,&#8221; and
Roberta beat the egg in the cupful of milk, added
a little sugar, and placed it in the oven. In a few
minutes it was a solid, excellent custard, and Margot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
enjoyed it very much. &#8220;I ne&#8217;er liked raw food,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and raw egg isna any more eatable than raw
fish, or raw meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the afternoon the Domine and Jamie came in,
and Roberta won his heart readily with her gay
good nature and thoughtful kindness to the sick
woman. He had put a letter into Christine&#8217;s hand,
as he came in and said to her, &#8220;Go your ways ben,
and read it, but say naething to your mither anent
its contents. Later I&#8217;ll give you good reasons for
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Christine went away, and opened her letter,
and there fell from it a five-pound note. And the
letter was from a great magazine, and it said the
money was for the &#8220;Fisherman&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; and he
would be very glad if she would write him more
about fishers. There were also a few pleasant words
of praise, but Christine&#8217;s eyes were full of happy
tears, she could not read them. What she did was
to lay the letter and the money on her bed, and kneel
down beside it, and let her silence and her tears
thank the God who had helped her. &#8220;I was brought
low and He helped me,&#8221; she whispered, as she bathed
her eyes and then went back to the company.</p>
<p>Such a happy afternoon followed! The Domine
was in a delightful mood, Jamie recited for the first
time &#8220;How Horatio Kept the Bridge,&#8221; and Margot
was as busy as her weak, old fingers would let her
be. With the Domine&#8217;s approval, Christine showed
her letter to Roberta, and they, too, held a little triumph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
over the good, clever girl, for it was not vanity
that induced her confidence, it was that desire for
human sympathy, which even Divinity feels, or He
would not ask it, and Himself prompt its offering.</p>
<p>Soon after five o&#8217;clock they had a cup of tea together,
and Roberta&#8217;s cab was waiting, and the fortunate
day was over. Roberta was sorry to go away.
She said she had had one of the happiest days of
her life. She left her own little silk crochet bag
with Margot, and gave her gladly her pretty silver
hook with its ivory handle, and the cotton she had
with her. She said she would send hooks of different
sizes, and the threads necessary for them, and also
what easy patterns she could find.</p>
<p>She went away amid smiles and blessings, and the
Domine and Jamie went with her. They would see
her safely to her hotel, they said, but she would not
part with them so early. She entreated them to dine
and spend the evening with her. And so they did.
And their talk was of Christine, of her love and patience,
and her night-and-day care. Even her orderly
house and personal neatness were duly praised.</p>
<p>Roberta left for her Glasgow home, early on the
following morning, and arrived at Monteith Row
a little wearied, but quite satisfied with the journey
she had taken. What the result to herself would
be, she could hardly imagine. But its uncertainty
kept her restless. She had resolved to clean and prepare
the house for winter, during her husband&#8217;s absence,
but she could not do it. A woman needs a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
stiff purpose in her heart, when she pulls her home
to pieces. If anything is going to happen, it usually
chooses such a time of discomfort and disorder.</p>
<p>She found it far more pleasant to select crochet
hooks and cotton for Margot and herself. She sent
the Domine a book that she knew would be acceptable,
and to Jamie she sent a Rugby School
pocket-knife, containing not only the knives, but the
other little tools a boy finds so necessary. To Christine
she sent a large, handsome portfolio, and such
things as a person addicted to writing poetry requires.
She could settle to nothing, for indeed she
felt her position to be precarious. She knew that
she could not live a day with Neil, unless he was able
to account satisfactorily for his theft&mdash;she called it
theft to herself&mdash;of the first ninety pounds.</p>
<p>Neil had promised to be home in a week, but it
was two weeks ere he returned. He said business
had detained him, and what can a woman say to
&#8220;business&#8221;? It appears to cover, and even cancel, all
other obligations. If there had been any tendency
in Roberta&#8217;s heart to excuse, or even to forgive her
husband, he killed the feeling by his continual excuses
for delay. The lawyer who had accompanied
him was home. What was Neil doing in London,
when the principal in the case had returned?</p>
<p>At last she received particular instructions as to
the train by which he would arrive. She took no notice
of them, though it had been her custom to meet
him. He was a little cross at this neglect, and more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
so, when the sound of his peremptory ring at the
door brought only a servant to open it. He did not
ask after her, and she did not appear, so he gave his
valise to the servant, with orders to take it into the
dining room. &#8220;I suppose your mistress is there?&#8221;
he asked. He was told she was there, and he added,
&#8220;Inform her that I am in my room preparing for
dinner, and order the cook to serve it at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roberta saw the valise brought in, and she made
no inquiries concerning it. She saw the dinner
brought on, and she seated herself in her place at
the table, and drew the chair holding the valise almost
to her side. Then she waited.</p>
<p>Neil entered the room immediately. She did not
turn her face to the door when it opened. She said
as if speaking to a servant, &#8220;Place the soup at the
head of the table. Mr. Ruleson is home.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he took the head of the table, and so faced
her, and could no longer be ignored, she said, &#8220;Is it
really you, Neil? By what train did you arrive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you, in my last letter, at what time I should
arrive in Glasgow. You did not meet me, as I expected.
I had to take a cab home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stable man said one of the horses was acting
as if it did not feel well. He thought it had better
not be driven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought it would be more comfortable to
stay at home this wet night. I had a very cold, disagreeable
drive. I dare say I have taken a severe
cold from it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The soup waits, if you will serve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did so, remarking the while, &#8220;I sent you
word I would be home by this train. Did you receive
my letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O you know, you have been coming by so many
trains the past week, I thought it best not to take the
sick horse out on such an uncertainty as your promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, as I told you, detained by business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you made it pay you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few hundreds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then you would not mind the expense of
a cab.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I ever mind necessary trifles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never considered the matter,&#8221; and the
little laugh of indifference which closed the sentence,
made him look at her attentively.</p>
<p>She was in full evening costume, and it struck him
that tonight she looked almost handsome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you intend to go out this evening? Has my
coming home prevented some social pleasure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had told Reginald to meet me in my box at
Glover&#8217;s Theater. Reginald is a social pleasure no
woman would willingly miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not approve of Reginald Rath, and I would
rather you did not invite him to our box. His presence
there, you know, would assuredly preclude
mine.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot interfere with dear Reggie&#8217;s rights.
The box is as much his, as mine. Father bought it
in perpetuity, when the theater was built. The
Merrys, and Taits, and others did the same&mdash;and
Father left it to Reggie and myself, equally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be very unpleasant to you, if Reginald
married a woman you did not like&mdash;and you really
approve of so few women&mdash;it is remarkable how
few&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I have found a woman since you went away,
that is perfect&mdash;as good and clever as she is beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my little romance. I will tell you about her
after dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not impatient.&#8221;</p>
<p>This kind of half-querulous conversation continued
during the service of dinner, but when the cloth
had been drawn, and the wine and the nuts promised
the absence of servants uncalled for, Roberta&#8217;s
attitude changed. She took a letter from her bag,
and pushed it towards Neil.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is your letter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it came ten days
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you open it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;haste&#8217; was on it, and I thought it
might be an announcement of your mother&#8217;s death,
or serious sickness&mdash;not that I thought you would
care&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I care.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better read the letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched his face gathering gloom and anger
as he did so, and when he threw it from him with
some unintelligible words, she lifted and put it again
in her bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my letter, Roberta, give it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have just flung it away from you. I am
going to keep it&mdash;it may be useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil, you must now answer me one or two questions.
On your answers our living together depends.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed softly, and said, &#8220;Nothing so serious
as that, surely, Roberta!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that. When you went to your father&#8217;s funeral,
you told me that you owed your sister ninety
pounds. You said it was her life&#8217;s savings from both
labor and gifts, and that she had loaned it to you,
in order to make possible your final year at the
Maraschal. You said further, that your father was
not a saving man, and you feared they would be
pinched for money to bury him. And I loaned you
ninety pounds, being glad to see such a touch of
natural affection in you. This letter from Christine
says plainly that you never paid her the ninety
pounds you borrowed from me. Is Christine telling
the truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, on your return, you gave me a rather tedious
account of your mother&#8217;s and Christine&#8217;s thankfulness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
for the money. It created in me a wrong impression
of your mother and sister. I asked myself
why they should be so crawlingly thankful to you for
paying a just debt, and I thought meanly of them.
Why did you not pay them the ninety pounds you
borrowed from them? And why did you invent that
servile bit of thankfulness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you, Roberta. When I got home I
found the whole village on my father&#8217;s place. The
funeral arrangements were, for a man in my father&#8217;s
position, exceedingly extravagant, and I was astonished
at my mother&#8217;s recklessness, and want of oversight.
Christine was overcome with grief, and everything
appeared to be left to men and women who
were spending other people&#8217;s money. I thought under
the circumstances it was better not to pay Christine
at that time, and I think I was right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, perhaps, you were prudent, but prudence
is naturally mean and as often wrong as right. And
why did you lie to me, so meanly and so tediously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to lie to women, if you alter in the
least anything you have told them. You cannot explain
to a woman, unless you want to stand all day
doing it. There are times when a lie is simply an
explanation, a better one than the truth would be.
The great Shakespeare held that such lies were more
for number, than account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not take my opinion of lies from William
Shakespeare. A lie is a lie. There was no need for
a lie in this case. The lie you made up about it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
for account, not for number&mdash;be sure of that. You
admit that you did not give Christine the ninety
pounds you borrowed from me, in order to pay your
debt to her. What did you do with the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any right to ask me that question?
If I borrowed ninety pounds from the bank, would
they ask me what I did with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I neither know nor care what the bank would do.
I am seeking information for Roberta Ruleson, and
I shall take my own way to obtain it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you did with that ninety pounds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I banked it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what bank? There is no record of it in the
Bank of Scotland, where I have always supposed,
until lately, our funds were kept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not put it in the Bank of Scotland. Every
business man has an official banking account, and
also a private banking account. I put that ninety
pounds to my private bank account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what bank?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not give that information to anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be pretty well known, since it has come
as a matter of gossip to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better say &#8216;advice&#8217; in place of gossip.
What advice did you get?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told to look after my own money, that you
were putting what little you made into the North
British Security.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose your clever brother told you that. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
Reginald Rath does not leave my affairs alone, I
shall make him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have a bad time doing it. Your check
books, no doubt, are in this valise. You will now
write me a check on the North British for one hundred
and eighty pounds. It is only fair that the
North British should pay out, as well as take in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I give you a check for a hundred and
eighty pounds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave you ninety pounds when you went to your
father&#8217;s funeral, I took ninety pounds to Culraine
ten days ago, in answer to the letter Christine
wrote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You went to Culraine? You, yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went, and I had there one of the happiest days
of my life. I got right into your mother&#8217;s heart,
and taught her how to crochet. I saw and talked
with your splendid sister. She is the most beautiful,
intelligent girl, I ever met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such nonsense! She knows nothing but what I
taught her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows many things you know nothing about.
I think she will become a famous woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Mother dies, she will marry Cluny Macpherson,
who is a Fife fisher, and settle down among
her class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw his picture, one of those new daguerreotypes.
Such a splendid-looking fellow! He was a
Fife fisher, he is now Second Officer on a Henderson
boat, and wears their uniform. But it is Christine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
I am telling you about. There is a new <i>Blackwood</i>
on the table at your right hand. Turn to the eleventh
page, and see what you find.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did so, and he found &#8220;The Fisherman&#8217;s
Prayer.&#8221; With a scornful face he read it, and then
asked, &#8220;Do you believe that Christine Ruleson wrote
that poem? I have no doubt it is the Domine&#8217;s
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not it. I saw the Domine. He and that lovable
lad he has adopted&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My nephew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dined at the hotel with me. I never before met
such a perfect man. I did not know such men lived.
The Domine was as happy as a child over Christine&#8217;s
success. She got five pounds for that poem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I read the letter in which it came. They praised
the poem, and asked for more contributions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she is making money, why give her ninety
pounds? It was absurd&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just and right. You say you have made
a few hundreds on this London case, you will now
write me a check for the two loans of ninety pounds
each.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not borrow the last ninety pounds. You
took it to Culraine of your own will and desire. I
do not owe the last ninety pounds. I refuse to pay
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you until tomorrow morning to change
your mind. When Christine wrote you the letter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
now in your hand, she had not a sixpence in the
world&mdash;her luck came with the money I took her.
I do not think she will ever require anyone&#8217;s help
again. Oh, how could you grudge even your last
penny to a sister like Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She owes everything to me. I opened up her
mind. I taught her to speak good English. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I borrowed all her life&#8217;s savings, kept the money
through the death of her father, the severe illness
of her mother, and the total absence of anyone in
her home to make money or in any way help her to
bear the burden and fatigue of her great strait.&#8217;
You can tell me in the morning what you propose
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she rose, and left the room, and Neil made
no offer to detain her. In fact he muttered to himself,
&#8220;She is a little premature, but it may be as
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning he rose while it was yet dark, and
leaving word with a servant that he was going to
Dalkeith and might be away four days, or longer, he
left in the gloom of fog and rain, and early twilight,
the home he was never to enter again. He had
grown accustomed to every luxury and refinement in
its well-ordered plenty, and he had not the slightest
intention of resigning its comfortable conditions, but
he had no conception of the kind of woman with
whom he had now to deal. The wives of Culraine,
while dominant in business, gave to their men, in the
household, almost an unquestioned authority; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Neil had no experience which could lead him to expect
Roberta would, in any essential thing, dare to
disobey him. He even flattered himself that in leaving
her alone he had left her to anxiety and unhappiness,
and of course, repentance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will just give her a little lesson,&#8221; he said to
himself, complacently. &#8220;She gave me until this
morning. I will give her four or five days of solitary
reflection, and no letters. No letters, Neil Ruleson!
I think that treatment will teach her other
people have rights, as well as herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roberta did not appear to be disquieted by his
absence. She sent a messenger for her brother, and
ate a leisurely, pleasant meal, with the <i>Glasgow
Herald</i> for a companion; and before she had quite
finished it, Reginald appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your early message alarmed me, Roberta,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I hope all is well with you, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Reggie, I don&#8217;t know whether it is well,
or ill. Sit down and I will tell you exactly how my
life stands.&#8221; Then she related circumstantially all
that had occurred&mdash;Neil&#8217;s first request for ninety
pounds at his father&#8217;s death&mdash;his appropriation of
that sum, and his refusal to say what had been done
with it&mdash;Christine&#8217;s letter of recent date which she
now handed to her brother. Reginald read it with
emotion, and said as he handed it back to his sister:
&#8220;It is a sweet, pitiful, noble letter. Of course he answered
it properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Roberta told him all the circumstances of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
her visit to Culraine, and when she had finished her
narration, her brother&#8217;s eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Reginald,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;did I do wrong in
going myself with the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up to the receipt of Christine&#8217;s letter, you supposed
it had been paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I did, and I thought Neil&#8217;s family rude
and unmannerly for never making any allusion to its
payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you paid it again, resolving to fight the affair
out with Neil, when he came home. You really accepted
the debt, and made it your own, and be sure
that Neil will find out a way to make you responsible
for its payment in law. In point of truth and honor,
and every holy affection, it was Neil&#8217;s obligation,
and every good man and woman would cry shame
on his shirking it. Roberta, you have made the supreme
mistake! You have allied yourself with a
mean, dishonorable caitiff&mdash;a creature in whose
character baseness and wickedness meet; and who
has no natural affections. As I have told you before,
and often, Neil Ruleson has one idea&mdash;money.
All the comforts and refinements of this home would
be instantly abandoned, if he had them to pay for.
He has a miserly nature, and only his love of himself
prevents him from living on a crust, or a few
potato parings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Reginald, you go too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not. When a man can grudge his good, loving
mother on her death-bed anything, or all that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
has, he is no longer fit for human companionship.
He should go to a cave, or a garret, and live alone.
What are you going to do? My dear, dear sister,
what are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you advise, Reginald. For this reason I
sent for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then listen. I knew a crisis of some kind must
soon come between you and that&mdash;creature, and this
is what I say&mdash;you must leave him. Every day you
stay with him insults your humanity, and your womanhood.
He says he will be four or five days away,
we will have plenty of time for my plan. Before
noon I will have here wagons and men in sufficient
number to empty this house into Menzie&#8217;s granite
storage in two days. Send the silver to the bank. I
will put it in a cab, and take it myself. Pack things
you value highly in one trunk, which can be specially
insured. Our pictures we will place in the Ludin
Picture Gallery. We can clear the house in three
days, and on the morning of the fourth day, young
Bruce Kinlock will move into it. If Neil can face
Kinlock, it will be the worse for him, for Kinlock&#8217;s
temper blazes if he but hear Neil&#8217;s name, and his
hand goes to his side, for the dirk with which his
fathers always answered an enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Reginald, when I have turned myself out
of house and home, what follows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will take a passage to New Orleans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;New Orleans! Why there? Such an out-of-the-way
place.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. That creature will argue thus&mdash;they
have gone to some place on the Continent&mdash;very
likely France. And he will probably try to make
you a deal of trouble. I have never named New
Orleans to anyone. Even our friends will never
suspect our destination, for we shall go first to
France, and take a steamer from some French port,
for New Orleans. When we arrive there, we have
a new world before us, and can please ourselves
where we go, and where we stay. Now, Roberta,
decide at once. We have time, but none too much,
and I will work night and day to get you out of the
power of such a husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may repent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will give him time and reason to do so. He
has been too comfortable. You have given him constant
temptation to wrong you. He will not repent
until he feels the pinch of poverty and the want of
a home. Then he may seek you in earnest, and I
suppose you will forgive him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could I do? Would not God forgive
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a subject for later consideration. If you
will take my advice you must do it with all your
heart, and be as busy as I will be. We want no altercation
with him just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you my word, Reggie, that for two years
I will do as you advise. Then we will reconsider
the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Reginald clasped her hand, and drew her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
to his side. &#8220;It is for your salvation, dear, every
way, and loneliness and deprivation may be for his
good. We will hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You once liked him, Reggie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. He betrayed me in every way he
could. He purposely quarreled with me. He
wanted a free hand to follow out his own business
ideas&mdash;which were not mine. But this is now idle
talk. Neil will never be saved by people helping
him. He must be left to help himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is hope enough to work on. Tell me now,
exactly what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reginald&#8217;s plans had long been perfected, and by
the noon of the third day the beautiful home was
nothing but bare walls and bare floors. That same
night, Reginald Rath and his sister left Glasgow by
the midnight train, and the following morning, Bruce
Kinlock, with his wife and five children, moved into
the dismantled house, and in two days it was in a
fairly habitable condition. There was, of course,
confusion and a multitude of bustling servants and
helpers, and a pretty, frail-looking little lady, sitting
helplessly in a large chair, and Bruce ordering
round, and five children in every place they ought
not be, but there was universal good temper, and
pleasurable excitement, and a brilliantly lighted
house, when on the following Saturday night, Neil
drove up to his residence.</p>
<p>He thought, at first, that Mrs. Ruleson had a
dinner party, then he remembered Roberta&#8217;s reverence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
for the Sabbath, and knew she would not permit
any dancing and feasting so near its daybreaking.
The Sabbath observance was also his own
strong religious tenet, he was an ardent supporter
of Doctor Agnew and his extremist views, and
therefore this illumination in the Ruleson mansion,
so near to the Sabbath-day, offended him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roberta knows that I am particular about my
good name, and that I am jealously careful of the
honor of the Sabbath, and yet&mdash;yet! Look at my
house! It is lit up as if for a carnival of witches!&#8221;
Then he hurried the cab man, and his keys being in
his hand, he applied the latch-key to the lock. It
would not move it, and the noise in the house
amazed him. He rang the bell violently, and no one
answered it. He raged, and rang it again. There
was plenty of movement in the house, and he could
plainly hear a man&#8217;s voice, and a guffaw of laughter.
He kept the bell ringing, and kicked the door with
his foot.</p>
<p>Then a passionate voice asked what he wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get in. This is my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not your house. It never was your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What number is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-three, Western Crescent. What Tomfool
asks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my house. Open the door, or I will call
the police.&#8221; He did call the policeman on the beat,
and the man said, &#8220;A new family moved in yesterday,
Sir, and I was taken from Hillside Crescent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
only two days ago. I am on the night watch. I
havena seen any o&#8217; them yet, but there seems to be a
big lot o&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where the family went, who lived
in twenty-three previous to this new tenant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard they went abroad&mdash;left in a great hurry,
as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Neil went back to the house, and rang the
door bell with polite consideration. &#8220;The new-comers
will certainly know more than the policeman,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;and I can get no letter till Monday
morning. It will be very annoying to be in this
doubt until then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had plenty of time for these reflections, for
the bell was not noticed, and he rang again with a
little more impetuosity. This time it was answered
by a huge Highlander, with a dog by a leash, and a
dogwhip in his hand; and Neil trembled with fear.
He knew the man. He had once been his lawyer,
and lost his case, and the man had accused him of
selling his case. There was no proof of the wrong,
none at all, and it was not believed by anyone except
Reginald Rath, and even Roberta allowed he
was too prejudiced to be fair. These circumstances
passed like a flash through Neil&#8217;s heart, as Bruce
Kinlock glared at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you show your face at my door?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Be off, you whippersnapper, or I&#8217;ll set the
dog on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always believed, until the present moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
that this was my house. Can you tell me
where my family has removed to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never had any right in this house but the
right of sufferance. Honest Reginald Rath has taken
your wife away&mdash;he&#8217;s done right. Ye know well
you are not fit company for the lady Roberta. As
for your family, they have the pity of everyone.
What kind of a brute is it that has not a shilling for
a dying mother, though he&#8217;s owing his family ninety
pounds, and far more love than he deserves. Go, or
it will be worse for you! You sneaking ne&#8217;er-do-well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinlock had spoken with inconceivable passion,
and the very sight of the red-headed, gigantic Highlander,
sputtering out words that cannot be written,
and of the growling brute, that only required a relaxed
hand to fly at his throat, made him faint with
terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, Mr. Kinlock&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How daur you &#8216;mister&#8217; me? I am Kinlock, of
Kinlock! You had better take yourself off. I&#8217;m at
the end of my patience, and I cannot hold this kind
of a brute much longer. And if he grabs any kind
of a human being, he never lets go while there&#8217;s life
in him. I can&#8217;t say how he would treat you&mdash;one
dog does not eat another dog, as a rule.&#8221; Then he
clashed-to the door, and Neil was grateful. He did
not ask again for it to be opened.</p>
<p>He went to his office. Perhaps there was a letter
for him there. It was locked, and the man who kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
the keys lived over the river. Thoroughly weary
and distressed, and full of anxious forebodings, he
went to a hotel, and ordered supper in his own room.
He did not feel as if he could look anyone in the
face, with this dreadful uncertainty hanging over his
life. What was the matter?</p>
<p>Thinking over things he came to no conclusion.
It could not be his few words with Roberta on the
night of his return from London. A few words of
contradiction with Roberta were almost a daily occurrence,
and she had always accepted such offers of
conciliation as he made. And he was so morally
obtuse that his treatment of his mother and sister,
as influencing his wife, never entered his mind.
What had Roberta to do with his mother and Christine?
Suppose he had treated them cruelly, what
right, or reason, had she to complain of that?
Everything was personal to Neil, even moralities;
he was too small to comprehend the great natural
feelings which make all men kin. He thought Kinlock&#8217;s
reference to his dying mother a piece of far-fetched
impertinence, but he understood very well
the justice of Kinlock&#8217;s personal hatred, and he
laughed scornfully as he reflected on the Highlander&#8217;s
longing to strike him with the whip, and then
set the dog to finish his quarrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Law! The gude Common Law o&#8217; Scotland
has the like o&#8217; sic villains as Kinlock by the
throat!&#8221; he said triumphantly. &#8220;He wad hae set
the brute at my throat, if he hadna kent it wad put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
a rope round his ain red neck. I hae got to my
Scotch,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;and that isna a good sign.
I&#8217;ll be getting a headache next thing. I&#8217;ll awa&#8217; to
bed, and to sleep. Monday will be a new day. I&#8217;ll
mebbe get some light then, on this iniquitous, unprecedented
circumstance.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, therefore, keep thy sorrow to thyself and bear with
a good courage that which hath befallen thee.&mdash;Esdras ii,

<p>Be not afraid, neither doubt, for God is your guide.&mdash;Esdras

</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was a cold winter day at the end of January,
and a streak of white rain was flying across the
black sea. Christine stood at the window,
gazing at her brother&#8217;s old boat edging away to
windward, under very small canvas. There was a
wild carry overhead, out of the northeast, and she
was hoping that Norman had noticed the tokens of
the sky. Margot saw her look of anxiety, and said:
&#8220;You needna worry yoursel&#8217;, Christine. Norman&#8217;s
boat is an auld-warld Buckie skiff. They&#8217;re the
auldest model on a&#8217; our coasts, and they can fend
in a sea that would founder a whole fishing fleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed Norman had lowered his mainsail
and hoisted the mizzen in its place, and that he was
edging away to windward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Norman kens what he must do, and he does
it. That&#8217;s his way. Ye needna fash anent Norman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
he&#8217;ll tak&#8217; his old Buckie skiff into a gale that yachts
wi&#8217; their lockers fu&#8217; o&#8217; prizes wouldna daur to venture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mither dear, there&#8217;s a wind from the north
blowing in savage gusts, and the black seas tumble
wild and high, and send clouds of spindrift to
smother the auld boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, weel! She&#8217;ll give to the squalls, and it&#8217;s
vera near the turn o&#8217; the tide, then the wind will gae
down, as the sea rises. The bit storm will tak&#8217; itsel&#8217;
off in a heavy mist and a thick smur, nae doubt o&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Norman will know all this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, will he! Norman is a wonderfu&#8217; man, for
a&#8217; perteening to his duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the door opened, and one of the Brodie boys
gave Christine two letters. &#8220;I thought ye wad be
glad o&#8217; them this gloomy day,&#8221; he said to Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Alick! You went a bit out o&#8217; your
road to pleasure us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s naething. Gude morning! I am in a wee
hurry, there&#8217;s a big game in the playground this
afternoon.&#8221; With these words the boy was gone,
and Christine stood with the letters in her hand.
One was from Cluny, and she put it in her breast, the
other was from Roberta, and she read it aloud to
her mother. It was dated New Orleans, and the
first pages of the letter consisted entirely of a
description of the place and her perfect delight in
its climate and social life.</p>
<p>Margot listened impatiently. &#8220;I&#8217;m no carin&#8217; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
that information, Christine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why is
Roberta in New Orleans? What is she doing in a
foreign land, and nae word o&#8217; Neil in the circumstance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just coming to that, Mither.&#8221; Then Christine
read carefully Roberta&#8217;s long accusation of her
husband&#8217;s methods. Margot listened silently, and
when Christine ceased reading, did not express any
opinion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do ye think, Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hae to hear Neil&#8217;s side, before I can judge.
When she was here, she said naething against Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not name him at all. I noticed that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put her letter awa&#8217; till we get Neil&#8217;s story. I&#8217;ll
ne&#8217;er blame my lad before I hae heard his side o&#8217;
the wrang. I&#8217;m disappointed in Roberta. Wives
shouldna speak ill o&#8217; their husbands. It isna lawfu&#8217;,
and it&#8217;s vera unwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The faults she names are quite in the line o&#8217;
Neil&#8217;s faults.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a gude thing he was keepit out o&#8217; the
ministry. The Maraschal was gude enough. I&#8217;m
thinking all the lad&#8217;s faults are quite in the line o&#8217;
the law. Put the letter awa&#8217;. I&#8217;m not going to tak&#8217;
it into my consideration, till Neil has had his say-so.
Let us hae a good day wi&#8217; a book, Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we will, Mither. I&#8217;ll red up the house, and
read my letter, and be wi&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some wee, short love stories and poems, and
the like. That verse you read me a week syne,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
anent the Lord being our shepherd, is singing in
my heart and brain, even the now. It was like as
if the Lord had but one sheep, and I mysel&#8217; was
that one. Gie me my crochet wark, and I will
listen to it, until you are through wi&#8217; your little
jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day grew more and more stormy, but these
two women made their own sunshine, for Margot
was now easy and pleasant to live with. Nothing
was more remarkable than the change that had
taken place in her. Once the most masterful, passionate,
plain-spoken woman in the village, she had
become, in the school of affliction and loss, as a
little child, and the relations between herself and
Christine had been in many cases almost reversed.
She now accepted the sweet authority of Christine
with pleasure, and while she held tenaciously to her
own likings and opinions, she no longer bluffed
away the opinions of others with that verbal contempt
few were able to reply to. Her whole nature
had sweetened, and risen into a mental and spiritual
region too high for angry or scornful personalities.</p>
<p>Her physical failure and decay had been very
slow, and at first exceedingly painful, but as her
strength left her, and her power to resist and struggle
was taken away with it, she had traveled through
the Valley of the Shadow of Death almost cheerfully,
for the Lord was with her, and her own dear
daughter was the rod that protected, and the staff
that comforted her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>They had a day of wonderful peace and pleasure,
and after they had had their tea, and Margot
had been prepared for the night, Christine had a
long sweet session with her regarding her own affairs.
She told her mother that Cluny was coming
to see her anent their marriage. &#8220;He really thinks,
Mither, he can be a great help and comfort to us
baith,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it is but three or four days in
a month he could be awa&#8217; from the ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want him here, dearie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a great pleasure to me, Mither. I
spend many anxious hours about Cluny, when the
weather is bad.&#8221; And Margot remembered how
rarely she spoke of this anxiety, or indeed of Cluny
at all. For the first time she seemed to realize the
girl&#8217;s unselfish love, and she looked at Christine
with eyes full of tears, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Write and tell Cluny to come hame. He is
welcome, and I&#8217;ll gie ye baith my blessing!&#8221; And
Christine kissed and twice kissed her mother, and
in that hour there was a great peace in the cottage.</p>
<p>This concession regarding Cluny was the breaking
down of Margot&#8217;s last individual bulwark. Not
by assault, or even by prudence, was it taken. A
long service of love and patience made the first
breach, and then Christine&#8217;s sweet, uncomplaining
reticence about her lover and her own hopes threw
wide the gates, and the enemy was told to &#8220;come
hame and welcome.&#8221; It was a great moral triumph,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
it brought a great satisfaction, and after her surrender,
Margot fell into a deep, restful sleep, and
Christine wrote a joyful letter to Cluny, and began
to calculate the number of days that must wear
away before Cluny would receive the happy news.</p>
<p>A few days after this event Christine began to
read to her mother &#8220;Lady Audley&#8217;s Secret,&#8221; and
she was much astonished to find her sleepy and indifferent.
She continued in this mood for some
days, and when she finally threw off this drowsy attitude,
Christine noticed a very marked change. What
had taken place during that somnolent pause in life?
Had the silver cord been loosed, or the golden bowl
broken, or the pitcher broken at the fountain?
Something had happened beyond human ken, and
though Margot made no complaint, and related no
unusual experience, Christine knew that her spirit
was ready to return unto God who gave it. And she
said to herself:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;As I work, my heart must watch,</p>
<p>For the door is on the latch,</p>
<p class='indent4'>In her room;</p>
<p>And it may be in the morning,</p>
<p class='indent4'>He will come.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>In the afternoon little Jamie came in, and Christine
told him to go very quietly to his grandmother,
and speak to her. She smiled when he did so, and
slowly opened her eyes. &#8220;Good-by, Jamie,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
said. &#8220;Be a good boy, be a good man, till I see
ye again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, Grandmother. I will! I promise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think o&#8217; her, Jamie?&#8221; asked Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she is dying, Auntie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go hame as quick as you can, and tell your
feyther to come, and not to lose a minute. Tell
him he must bring the Cup wi&#8217; him, or I&#8217;m feared
he&#8217;ll be too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Domine&#8217;s voice roused Margot a little. She
put out her trembling hand, and the likeness of a
smile was on her face. &#8220;Is He come?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few more shadows, Margot, and He will
come. I have brought the Cup with me, Margot.
Will you drink the Wine of Remembrance now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, will I&mdash;gladly!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Domine and Christine ate and drank the
sacred meal with her, and after it she seemed clearer
and better, and the Domine said to her, &#8220;Margot,
you will see my dear old friend, James Ruleson,
very soon now. Will you tell him I send him my
love? Will you tell him little Jamie is my son now,
and that he is going to make the name of James
Ruleson stand high in the favor of God and
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him a&#8217; anent Jamie&mdash;and anent Christine,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dead wait and long for news of the living
they love. Someway, sooner or later, good news
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
will find them out, and make even heaven happier.
Farewell, Margot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the evening there came that decided
lightening which so often precedes death. Margot
asked for Norman, and while he knelt beside
her, she gave him some instructions about her burial,
and charged him to stand by his sister Christine.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be her lane,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8217;til my year is
gane by, and the warld hates a lone woman who
fends for hersel&#8217;. Stay wi&#8217; Christine tonight. Tell
Christine to come to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Christine was at her side, she asked, &#8220;Do
you remember the verses in the wee, green book?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Called &#8216;Coming&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay&#8221;&mdash;and she added very slowly the first few
words she wished to hear&mdash;&#8220;It may be when the
midnight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>&#8220;Is heavy upon the land,</p>
<p>And the black waves lying dumbly</p>
<p class='indent4'>Along the sand,</p>
<p>When the moonless night draws close,</p>
<p>And the lights are out in the house,</p>
<p>When the fires burn low and red,</p>
<p>And the watch is ticking loudly,</p>
<p class='indent4'>Beside the bed.</p>
<p>Though you sleep tired out, on your couch</p>
<p>Still your heart must wake and watch,</p>
<p class='indent4'>In the dark room.</p>
<p>For it may be that at midnight,</p>
<p class='indent4'>I will come.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>And then Norman said solemnly, &#8220;In such an hour
as you think not, He will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>About ten o&#8217;clock Christine caught an anxious
look in her eyes, and she asked, &#8220;What is it, Mither,
dear Mither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil!&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Did ye send for the lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he does come, gie him the words I send
him. You ken what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will say and do all you told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But dinna be cross wi&#8217; the laddie. Gie him a
fair hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is sorry for a&#8217; he has done&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He willna be sorry. Ye must e&#8217;en forgie him,
sorry or not&mdash;Ye ken what the Domine said to me&mdash;when
I spoke&mdash;o&#8217; forgiving Neil&mdash;when he&mdash;was
sorry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine said you were to remember, that
while we were yet sinners God loved us, and Christ
died for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, while we&mdash;were&mdash;yet&mdash;sinners! that leaves
room for Neil&mdash;and everybody else, Christine&mdash;Christine&mdash;I
am weary, bairns&mdash;I will go to sleep
now&mdash;gude night!&#8221;</p>
<p>Death had now become a matter of consent to
Margot. She surrendered herself to her Maker,
and bade her children &#8220;goodnight!&#8221;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Her life had many a hope and aim,</p>
<p>Duties enough and little cares,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And now was quiet and now astir,</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>until God&#8217;s hand beckoned her into His school of affliction.
Now in the House not made with Hands
she understands the meaning of it all.</p>
<p>The next week was a particularly hard one to
Christine. In the long seclusion of her mother&#8217;s
illness, and in the fascination which study now had
for her, the primitive burial rites of Culraine were
an almost unbearable trial. Every woman who had
ever known Margot came to bid her a last earthly
farewell. Some cried, some volubly praised her,
some were sadly silent, but all were alike startled
by the mighty change that affliction and death had
made in the once powerful, handsome, tremendously
vitalized woman, who had ruled them all by the
sheer force of her powerful will and her wonderful
vitality. Pale and cold, her raven hair white as
snow, her large strong hands, shrunk to skin and
bone, clasped on her breast, and at rest forever&mdash;they
could hardly believe that this image of absolute
helplessness was all that was left of Margot
Ruleson.</p>
<p>For three days the house was always full, and
Christine was troubled and questioned on every
hand. But for three days long a little brown bird
sat on a holly tree by her window, and sang something
that comforted her. And the sweet, strong
song was for her alone. Nobody else noticed it.
She wondered if they even saw the little messenger.
On the afternoon of the third day, the Domine,
standing at the head of the coffin, spoke to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
men and women who filled the house. His eyes
were dim with tears, but his voice had the strong,
resonant ring of a Faith that knew it was well with
the dead that die in the Lord. It was mainly
to the living he spoke, asking them solemnly, &#8220;What
does the Lord require of you? Only this service&mdash;that
you do justly, and love mercy, and walk
humbly with your God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Margot&#8217;s sons, Norman and Eneas, lifted
the light coffin. The Domine walked in front of it,
and all the men present followed them to the open
grave, in the old kirk yard. In Scotland women
do not go to the grave. Christine locked herself
in her room, and the women mourners gradually
returned to their homes.</p>
<p>That night she was quite alone, and she could
give free outlet to her love, and grief, and hope.
She felt her mother in every room. She could not
believe she had gone far away. At times, walking
about the desolate house, she called her mother
with passionate weeping again, in the soft low voice
that she had used when soothing her pain and weariness.
At length even her superb vitality gave way,
and she fell upon her bed in a comforting, restorative
sleep.</p>
<p>Morning found her ready and able to face the
new life. She rose with the dawn, ate her breakfast,
and then lifted the hardest duty before her.
This was to brush and carefully fold away Margot&#8217;s
last simple clothing. Margot herself had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
cared for her one silk dress, her bits of lace, and
the beads and rings and combs of the days of her
health and vanity. Christine had seen her face
wet with tears as she locked them in the trunk, and
had kissed those tears away with promises of renewed
life. But there was no one with her to kiss
away the tears she shed over the simple gowns of
Margot&#8217;s last hard days. As she was doing this
loving duty, she thought of the angels folding up
neatly the simple linen garments in which Christ
had been buried. With such thoughts in her heart,
oh how lovingly she stroked the plain cotton gowns,
and the one black merino skirt, that had made up
Margot&#8217;s last wardrobe. Her tears dropped over
them, and she turned the key with a little cry so
heart-broken that no doubt her angel wept with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Mither, Mither!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;how little had
ye for a&#8217; the days o&#8217; your hard, sorrowfu&#8217;, painfu&#8217;,
fifty-five years&mdash;for a&#8217; your loveless girlhood&mdash;for
a&#8217; your wifely watchings and fearings for feyther
on the stormy seas&mdash;for a&#8217; your mitherhood&#8217;s pains
and cares&mdash;for the lang, cruel years you were walking
i&#8217; the Valley o&#8217; the Shadow o&#8217; Death&mdash;for a&#8217;
the years o&#8217; your hard, daily wark, loving and tending
your six sons and mysel&#8217;, feeding, dressing, and
makin&#8217; us learn our catechism and our Bible verses&mdash;curing
fish, and selling fish, makin&#8217; nets, and mending
nets, cooking and knitting and sewing. Surely
the good Master saw it all, and will gie you His
&#8216;well done,&#8217; and the wage ye hae earned.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>The bits of crochet work that her mother&#8217;s trembling
fingers had made&mdash;her last work one little
table mat unfinished&mdash;had a strange sacredness, and
a far more touching claim. She took these to her
own room. &#8220;They hold Mither&#8217;s last thoughts.
They seem a part o&#8217; her. I&#8217;ll never lose sight o&#8217;
them while I draw breath o&#8217; life. Never!&#8221; And
she kissed and folded them up, with the dried rose
leaves from Margot&#8217;s garden.</p>
<p>Then she stayed her tears, and looked round the
disordered house. Everything was out of its proper
place. That circumstance alone made her miserable,
for Christine was what her neighbors called a
&#8220;pernickity&#8221; housekeeper. She must have a place
for everything, and everything in its place. Until
she had her home in this precise condition, she resolved
to take no other trouble into consideration.
And simple and even derogatory as it appears to be,
nothing is more certainly efficacious in soothing grief,
than hard physical labor. It took her two days
to put the cottage in its usual spotless condition,
and during those two days, she gave herself no
moment in which to think of any trouble before
her.</p>
<p>She knew well that there must be trouble. Her
mother&#8217;s burial money, put away twenty-nine years
previously, had proved quite insufficient for modern
ideals and modern prices. She was nearly out of
money and there would be debts to meet, and every
debt would be to her like a wolf baying round the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
house. That was one trouble. Cluny was another.
She knew he would now urge an immediate marriage,
and that his plea would have an appearance
of extreme justice. She also knew that he would
be supported by Norman, whose wife had long set
her heart on occupying the Ruleson cottage. That
was a second trouble. The third was Neil. He
had been immediately notified of his mother&#8217;s death,
and he had taken no notice of the event. The other
boys not present, were all at sea, but where was
Neil?</p>
<p>These things she would not yet permit her mind
to consider.&mdash;In fact, the tossed-up, uncleanly house,
dulled her faculties. She could not think clearly,
until all was spotless and orderly. Then she could
meet trouble clear-headed and free-handed. However,
on the third evening after her mother&#8217;s burial,
every corner of the house satisfied her. Even her
dusters and cleaning-cloths had been washed and
gone to their special corner of the kitchen drawer;
and she had felt, that afternoon, that she could
comfortably arrange her paper and pencils on the
table of her own room.</p>
<p>She was eager to write. Her heart and brain
burned with the thoughts and feelings she longed to
express. &#8220;Tomorrow,&#8221; she said to herself&mdash;&#8220;Tomorrow,
I shall go on with my book.&#8221; Three months
previously she had begun a story to be called &#8220;A
Daughter of the Sea,&#8221; but lately she had been obliged
to lay it aside. She found &#8220;the bits o&#8217; poetry,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
were all she could manage in the short intervals of
time that were her own.</p>
<p>My readers may reflect here, on the truth that
there is no special education for a writer. The man
or woman who has anything to say to the world,
brings the ability to declare it with him. Then all
the accidents and events of life stimulate the power
which dwells in the heart and brain, and the happy
gift speaks for itself. Christine had been making
up poetry ever since she could remember, and while
yet a child had been the favorite story-teller in all
the social gatherings at Culraine. And it is not
unlikely that a good story-teller may turn out to be
a good story-writer.</p>
<p>About one-third of her first novel, &#8220;A Daughter
of the Sea,&#8221; was completed, and now, with a happy
resolution, she sat down to finish it. She did not
have the material to seek, she had only to recollect
and write down. The day passed with incredible
swiftness, and early in the evening Norman opened
the door, and saw her sitting by the fire. Her hands
were clasped above her head, and there was the
shadow of a smile on her still face.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Norman!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;how glad I am to see
you! Nobody has been here since&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, dear. Folks hae thought it was the
kinder thing to stop away, and let you get the
house in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it was. Come in, and see it, now that
everything is in its place.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>So Norman went through all the large, pleasant
rooms with her, and he could not help a sigh, as
he contrasted them with his own untidy and not
over-cleanly house. Then they returned to the ordinary
living-room, and when they were seated, Norman
lit his pipe, and they talked lovingly of the
mother who had gone away, and left her earthly
home full of sweet memories. They spoke in soft,
tender voices. Christine wept a little, and smiled a
little, as she told of her mother&#8217;s last days, and
Norman&#8217;s mouth twitched, and his big brown eyes
were heavy with unshed tears.</p>
<p>After this delay, Norman put away his pipe, and
bending forward with his elbows on his knees, and
his head in his hands, he said, &#8220;Christine, I hae
brought you a message. I hated to bring it, but
thought it would come more kindly from my lips,
than in any ither way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, Norman, what is it? Who sent you wi&#8217;
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife sent me. She says she will be obligated
to you, if you&#8217;ll move out o&#8217; the Ruleson cottage, as
soon as possible. She is wanting to get moved
and settled ere the spring fishing begins. These
words are hers, not mine, Christine. I think however
it is right you should know exactly what
you hae to meet. What answer do you send
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may tell her, Norman, that I will ne&#8217;er
move out o&#8217; the Ruleson cottage. It is mine as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
long as I live, and I intend to hold, and to live
in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessy has persuaded hersel&#8217; and a good many
o&#8217; the women in the village, that you ought to marry
Cluny as soon as he comes back to Glasgow, and
go and live in that city, so as to make a kind o&#8217;
a home there, for the lad. There was a crowd o&#8217;
them talking that way, when I came up frae the
boat this afternoon, and old Judith was just scattering
them wi&#8217; her fearsome words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Norman, I shall not marry until a year is full
o&#8217;er from Mither&#8217;s death. Mither had the same
fear in her heart, and I promised her on the Sacred
Word, which was lying between us at the time,
that I wouldna curtail her full year o&#8217; remembrance,
no, not one minute! That is a promise made to
the dead. I would not break it, for a&#8217; the living
men in Scotland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were talking of Cluny&#8217;s rights, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cluny hes no rights but those my love gives
him. I will not marry for a year, at least. I will
not live in Glasgow. I will bide in my ain hame.
It suits me fine. I can do a&#8217; the writing I want to
do in its white, still rooms. I can see wee Jamie
here every day. I am out o&#8217; clash and claver o&#8217;
the village folk. I can watch the sea and the ships,
and feel the winds, and the sunshine, and do my
wark, and eat my morsel in parfect peace. Na, na,
the auld hame suits me fine! Tell your wife Christine
Ruleson will live and die in it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>Norman did not move or speak, and Christine
asked anxiously, &#8220;Do you wish me to leave Culraine,
and go to Glasgow, Norman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not! Your wish is mine, and if Mither
were here today, I know she would scorn any proposal
that brought Jessy here. She never liked
Jessy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her liking or disliking did not influence her will
about the house. She loved every stone in this
cottage, and above all she loved her garden, and
her flowers. Tell me, Norman, if Jessy came here,
how long would the house be in decent order? And
where would Mither&#8217;s bonnie flower-garden be, by
the end o&#8217; the spring weather? For Mither&#8217;s sake
I&#8217;ll tak&#8217; care o&#8217; the things she loved. They werna
many, and they werna worth much, but they were
all she had, for her hard working life, and her
sair suffering. And she relied on you, Norman.
She said in her last hours, &#8216;If things are contrary,
Christine, and you can&#8217;t manage them,
ca&#8217; on Norman, and nane else. Norman will
stand by his sister, if a&#8217; the warld was against
her.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, will he! Blood is thicker than water. We
had the same Feyther and Mither. Nane better
ever lived,&#8221; and he stretched out his hand, and Christine
clasped it, and then he kissed her, and went
away.</p>
<p>Jessy was waiting for him. &#8220;Ye hae been a
mortal lang time, Norman,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hae been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
that narvous and unsettled i&#8217; my mind, I couldna
even get a bite ready for ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel ye be to settle yoursel&#8217; now, Jessy; for
my sister has her mind fixed on the way she has set
hersel&#8217;, and naebody will be able to move her. Naebody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she getting her wedding things ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is going to wear blacks for the full year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nae occasion for her to cast them. She
can put on a white gown for the ceremony. I suppose
they will hae the Domine come to the house
and marry them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going ayont a&#8217; probabilities, Jessy.
Christine willna marry for a full year. I am not
sure she will ever marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She be to marry! Of course she&#8217;ll marry! She
canna mak&#8217; a leeving oot a&#8217; a few bits o&#8217; poetry! She
be to marry! All women hae to marry. Where
is she going to bide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just where she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not hear tell o&#8217; that. The house is yours.
After the widow&#8217;s death, the home comes to the
auldest son. That&#8217;s the law o&#8217; Scotland, and I&#8217;m
vera sure it&#8217;s the law o&#8217; England likewise. It&#8217;s
the right law. When folks break it, the break is
for sorrow. There was Robert Toddie, who left
his house and land to his daughter Jean, and she
married her lad, and took him to live there&mdash;never
heeding her brother&#8217;s right&mdash;and baith her bairn and
hersel&#8217; died within a twelvemonth, and sae Robert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
cam&#8217; to his ain, and he&#8217;s living in the Toddie house
this day. Why dinna ye speak to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae heard ye tell the Toddie story till it&#8217;s worn
awa&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How was the house looking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean and bright as a new-made pin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! I&#8217;ll just tak&#8217; the bairns and go
up there! One room is a&#8217; she&#8217;s needing, and I
canna spare her that vera lang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not daur to tak&#8217; a step up there. Ye
hae no mair right there, than you hae in the schoolmaster&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae every right there. I hae got the best o&#8217;
advice on the subject. I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; the law stands
aboon your opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even the law and the fifteen lords o&#8217; Edinburgh
could gie you the right to put your foot on
that place, in the way of the right. Christine is
mistress o&#8217; Ruleson&#8217;s, mistress and owner. That,
and naething less!&#8221;</p>
<p>Norman was very unhappy. He could not get
the idea of his right to Ruleson cottage out of his
wife&#8217;s mind, and he had understood from the laying
of its first stone that the building was to be for a
home for Margot and Christine as long as either of
them lived. He had some sentimental feelings also
about the place, for Norman was a dumb poet, and
both in his brain and heart the elements of humanity
were finely mixed. But he was reticent and
self-denying, and the work of his hands being needed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
by the rapidly increasing family, he had put forth
no personal claims. Longing for knowledge and
the wisdom of the schools, he had gone silently and
cheerfully to the boats and lifted the oars at his
father&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>But the house he had helped to build was dear
to him. The image of his grave, kind father still
sat in the big chair by the fireside, and his mother&#8217;s
quick step, and cheerful voice, and busy household
ways, were yet the spirit of the building. He loved
its order and cleanliness, and its atmosphere of home
and hospitality. Sitting by his fireside that night,
he constantly contrasted it with his own disorderly,
noisy dwelling, with his slip-shod wife, and her uncertain
and generally belated meals. And his purpose
was immovable.</p>
<p>During this silent session with himself, his wife
never ceased talking. Norman was oblivious both
to her entreaties and her threats. But as he rose
and laid down his pipe, she laid her hand on his
arm, and said, &#8220;Gudeman, ye hae heard what I hae
said, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae heard naething since I told you that
Christine was owner and mistress o&#8217; Ruleson cottage.
Let be, Jessy, I&#8217;m weary and ready for
sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll hear this word, and then ye may sleep
awa&#8217; what little sense you hae left. I&#8217;ll go the
morn into the town, and see Lawyer Forbes, and
you&#8217;ll mebbe believe him when he serves Christine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
wi&#8217; a notice to quit, and tak&#8217; her belongings&mdash;poems
and a&#8217;&mdash;wi&#8217; her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If such a thing could happen, I should at once
hae it deeded back to her, as a gift. Listen, woman,
to my last word on this matter&mdash;if you could by
any means get possession o&#8217; the house, ye would
hae it from foundation to roof-bigging, all to yoursel&#8217;!
Neither I, nor any o&#8217; my children, would cross
its doorstane. That&#8217;s a fact, as sure as death!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldna tak&#8217; my childer from me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could, and I would. Tak&#8217; your will, you foolish
woman! I shall bide by every word I hae said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Norman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go! You hae never yet seen me in a blaze!
Dinna try it tonight! If I lift my hand it will be
your ain fault. Get out o&#8217; my sight, and hearing!
Quick, woman! Quick! I&#8217;m no&#8217; able to stand you
langer&mdash;O God! O God, help me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessy, cowed and shocked at this unexpected passion
of a patient man, disappeared; but the next
moment she was heard in the children&#8217;s room, crying
and scolding, and the sharp slapping of her hand
followed. Norman jumped to his feet, his heart
throbbed and burned, he clenched his hands, and took
a step forward. The next moment he had sat down,
his eyes were closed, his hands were clasped, he had
hid himself in that secret sanctuary which his hard
life and early disappointments had revealed to him,
when he was only a lad of seventeen. Jessy&#8217;s railing,
the children&#8217;s crying, his own angry voice, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
heard them not! He was hiding in His pavilion, in
the secret of His tabernacle. He had cast his burden
upon the Lord. He was in perfect peace.</p>
<p>Christine spent a restless, unhappy night. Norman
had put before her a future that frightened her.
She had seen the misery made by little wicked innuendoes
half a dozen words long. Truly words
could not kill her, but they could make life bitter
and friendless, and there were women in the village
she could neither conciliate, nor cope with, for
the weapons they used were not in her armory.
&#8220;Mither had a sharp tongue,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;but
even she couldna cope wi&#8217; a lying tongue. Weel,
there&#8217;s words anent it, in the Good Book, and I&#8217;ll
seek them out, and they&#8217;ll be helping me.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, the central trouble of her heart was
neither her house, nor her neighbors, nor even her
lover. Someway or other, they could and would be
managed. But how was she to refill her empty purse?
There was only one half-crown in it, and she had
already found out the cruel uncertainty of literary
work. It depended on too many people. Her
novel was three-fourths done, but she reasoned that
if men were so long on finding out whether they liked
half a dozen verses, it would be all of a year, ere
they got her novel well-examined. After realizing
this condition, she said firmly, and with no evidence
of unusual trial, &#8220;I can tak&#8217; to the fish, in the meantime.
I havna outgrown my fisher dress, nor forgot
my fisher-calls, and Culraine folk will help me sell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
if I look to the boats for my bread. They dinna
understand the writing business&mdash;nae wonder!
There&#8217;s few do! The Domine was saying it belongs
to the mysteries o&#8217; this life. Weel, I&#8217;ll get my pleasure
out o&#8217; it, and the fish are ay sure to come, and
sure to be caught, and if I set mysel&#8217; to the business,
I can beat the auldest and youngest o&#8217; the
fisherwomen in the selling o&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she came to this decision, the clock struck
twelve, and she looked up at its face for a moment,
and shook her head. &#8220;I canna sleep yet,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and you needna be calling me. There&#8217;s Cluny
and Neil to think o&#8217;, and dear me, wha&#8217; can Neil
be hiding himsel&#8217;? He canna hae heard o&#8217; Mither&#8217;s
death, he would hae come here, and if he couldna
come, he would hae written. There has been nae
word, either, from that lass he married. She wrote
seven lang pages o&#8217; faults and accusations again
her lawful husband, and then let the matter drop,
as if it was of no further consequence. I didn&#8217;t
answer her letter, and I am glad I didn&#8217;t. And I
canna write now, for I know no more anent her
whereabouts, than I do anent Neil&#8217;s. I wouldn&#8217;t
wonder if they are together in some heathen country,
where men fight duels, and kill each other for
an ugly word. In a case like that, it would be fair
murder for poor Neil. I wish I knew where the
misguided lad is! Norman and Neil had no marriage
luck, and wha kens what my luck may be, in
the way o&#8217; a husband!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>This intensely personal reflection claimed her
whole attention. It was long since she had seen
Cluny. Shortly before her mother&#8217;s death, he had
gone as supercargo on a large merchant steamer,
bound for New Zealand. It was a most important
post, and he had been promised, if successful, the first
captaincy in the fleet of passenger steamers carrying
between England and the United States, that
was vacant. Before leaving on this long trip to
New Zealand, he had only managed to see Christine
for three hours. He had reached Culraine at
eight o&#8217;clock. He had run like a deer the mile and
quarter which lay between the railway station and
the Ruleson cottage, reaching his goal just as Christine
finished reading a goodnight psalm to her
mother. She had heard his steps afar off, it had
seemed as if the comforting words were read to
them&mdash;then she was at the open door, and they met
in each other&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>Three hours of pure, perfect happiness had followed.
Cluny went first to Margot&#8217;s side. He
knew it was the last time he could ever stand there.
In this world they would see each other no more,
and he was sorrowfully shocked and touched by the
change in the handsome woman, once so vibrant
and full of life. Sometimes they had not been very
good friends, but this white, frail image, stretching
out hands full of pleasure and goodwill to him&mdash;this
gentle mother of the beloved Christine, won in a
moment all his best sympathies. He promised her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
everything she asked, and then she sent him away
with her blessing.</p>
<p>So it had been three hours of marvelous happiness.
They had been content to forget all things
but the joy of each other&#8217;s presence. To the last
possible minute he had remained with her, and their
hopeful farewell had not been dimmed by a single
tear. Since that night, she had sent no anxious
worrying thoughts after him. From every port at
which his ship touched, he had written her long,
loving letters, and now she was beginning to expect
his return. Any day she might have a letter from
him, dated Liverpool or Glasgow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lat them talk,&#8221; she said with a little defiant
laugh. &#8220;Lat their tongues tak&#8217; their ain ill-way,
I&#8217;m not feared. There&#8217;s Norman at my side, and
the Domine not far off, and God aboon us all. I&#8217;ll
speak to Norman anent the fishing, and if needs be,
I can kipper the herring as weel as Mither did.&#8221;
Then in a moment a wonderful change came over
her, the angry scorn of her attitude, and the proud
smile on her handsome face vanished. She clasped
her hands, and with the light of unconquerable love
on her face, she said with tender eagerness&mdash;&#8220;What
does she do now? Oh dear God, what is Mither
doing now? I canna tell. I canna tell, but it is
Thy will, I&#8217;m sure o&#8217; that.&#8221; Then the loving tears
that followed this attitude washed away all traces
of her scorn and anger, and she lay down with
prayer on her lips, and fell sweetly asleep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They that sin, are enemies to their own life.&mdash;Tobit,
xii, 10.</p>
<p>But Thou sparest all, for they are Thine, O Lord, Thou
Lover of Souls.&mdash;Wisdom of Solomon, xi, 26.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Tomorrow</span> is always another day, always
a new day, and as long as we live, always
our day. It will bring us our little freight
of good or evil, and we must accept it, our salvation
being that we have the power of turning the
evil into good, by the manner in which we accept it.
When Christine awoke in the morning, she awoke
all at once. No faculty of the Inner Woman dozed
or lingered, every sense of the physical woman was
attent, even sight&mdash;which often delays after its sister
senses are conscious&mdash;promptly lifted its curtains,
and Christine knew in a moment that she was
<i>all there</i>, every sense and faculty alert, and ready
for whatever the new day brought her.</p>
<p>She thought first of the trouble that Jessy was
likely to make. &#8220;The maist o&#8217; the women will side
wi&#8217; Jessy,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;not because they like her,
but because they dearly like a quarrel. I&#8217;ll not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
quarrel with them. I&#8217;ll bide at hame, and if they
come up here, I&#8217;ll bolt the doors on them. That&#8217;s
settled. I can neither keep back, nor hurry forward
Cluny, sae I&#8217;ll just put him in God&#8217;s care, and
leave him there. Neil has ta&#8217;en himsel&#8217; out o&#8217; my
kindness and knowledge, I can only ask God to gie
his angel a charge concerning him. The great queston
is, how am I to get my bread and tea? There&#8217;s
plenty o&#8217; potatoes in the house, and a pennyworth
o&#8217; fish will make me a meal. And I am getting a
few eggs from the hens now, but there&#8217;s this and
that unaccountable thing wanted every day; and
I hae just two-and-sixpence half-penny left. Weel!
I&#8217;ll show my empty purse to the Lord o&#8217; heaven
and earth, and I&#8217;m not doubting but that He will
gie me a&#8217; that is gude for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put down her tea cup decisively to this declaration,
and then rose, tidied her house and herself,
and sat down to her novel. With a smile she
opened her manuscript, and looked at what she had
accomplished. &#8220;You tiresome young woman,&#8221; she
said to her heroine. &#8220;You&#8217;ll hae to make up your
mind vera soon, now, whether ye&#8217;ll hae Sandy Gilhaize,
or Roy Brock. I&#8217;ll advise you to tak&#8217; Sandy,
but I dinna think you&#8217;ll do it, for you are a parfect
daffodil o&#8217; vanity, and you think Roy Brock is mair
of a gentleman than Sandy. I dinna ken what to
do wi&#8217; you!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here the door was noisily opened, and Jamie
rushed in, crying &#8220;Auntie, Auntie! I hae three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
letters for you, and one o&#8217; them came a week
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Jamie, why did you not go to the post office
before this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was getting ready for my exam&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gie me the letters, laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I could not get off till this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long letter from Cluny, but it was
not the delayed letter; and when Jamie had gone
home, she gave her whole heart to the reading of
it. Then she turned anxiously to the other two.
Both of them contained small checks for poems written
so long ago that she had quite forgotten them.
They were, however, veritable godsends, and she
thanked God for them. Now she could go to work.
She could even take time to make her foolish heroine
do the proper thing. She felt as rich, with her
two pounds, as if the two had been twenty. And
Cluny was on his way home! Her letter had been
posted at Auckland, and he was about to leave there,
for home, when he wrote.</p>
<p>The novel now progressed rapidly. It was writing
itself, and &#8220;The Daughter of the Sea&#8221; was all
the company Christine wanted. Norman came up
the hill once in the day, or he sent his son Will,
in his place, and Jamie always ate his lunch beside
Aunt Christine, and sometimes Judith called to see
if there was any news of Cluny. Sunday was her
day of trial. Ill-will can make itself felt, and never
say a word, and Christine noticed that everyone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
drew away from her. If Judith, or Peter Brodie,
or anyone spoke to her, they were at once set apart.
Everyone else drew away, and the very girls to
whom she had been kindest, drew furthest away.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, a good thing for her. She only
drew the closer to God, and her pen was a never-failing
friend and companion. The days flew by,
in the nights she slept and dreamed, and now and
then the Domine came in, and comforted and
strengthened her. Then she read him little chapters
from her book, and he gave her much good advice,
and sufficient praise to encourage her. So week
after week went on, and though the whole village
really disapproved of her retaining the Ruleson cottage,
she nearly forgot the circumstance. And the
book grew and grew in beauty, day by day, until on
one lovely June afternoon, the pretty heroine married
Sandy Gilhaize, and behaved very well ever
afterward.</p>
<p>The Domine came in and found her flushed and
excited over the wedding, and the parting, and he
took the book away with him, and told her he would
look after its sale, and she was to worry no more
about it. &#8220;Try and forget it exists, Christine, then
neither your wishing nor your fearing will interfere
with the fortune your good angel intends for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to gie the house a good clean, frae
the roof to the doorstep,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;and when
I hae that business on hand, it is all I can think
about.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is not cleaning the house again a work of supererogation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken what kind o&#8217; wark that may be,
Sir, but Mither always cleaned the house weel, before
the herring came. She&#8217;ll be expecting me to
do the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the Domine took away the manuscript, and
Christine cleaned her house with even extra care,
and one night a week afterwards, she sat down to
her cup of tea, telling herself that there wasna a
speck o&#8217; dust from the roof to the doorstane. &#8220;Even
the knives and forks shine like siller,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
the bath-brick board wouldna file the cleanest duster.&#8221;
She was personally in the same spotless
condition, and the little scone, and bit of baked
fish, and the cup of tea on the snow white tablecloth,
only emphasized this sense of absolute
purity.</p>
<p>As she was drinking her tea, Norman lifted the
latch and entered, and she greeted him joyfully.
&#8220;Come awa&#8217; and welcome,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I was just
longing to see you. Bring a cup and saucer off the
rack, laddie, and sit down, and tell me what&#8217;s going
on in the village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, the great news is the nearness o&#8217; the herrin&#8217;.
From a&#8217; accounts we may hae them in our bay
in a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad o&#8217; the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna think you would be carin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I care? I am longing to mak&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
some money. I intend to tak&#8217; up my mither&#8217;s kippering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad o&#8217; that. Why should ye let it slip
through your fingers? I heard tell that Nancy Baird
was thinking o&#8217; taking Mither&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll do naething o&#8217; that kind. Mither took
pains to fit me for that wark, and I am going to
do it wi&#8217; all my might. Norman, what can you do
to mak&#8217; it easy for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I came here to talk to you about.
I&#8217;ll tell Willie he is your gillie, as it were, for the
fishing. He will carry the fish to the shed for you,
and dinna forget Mither&#8217;s cubby there is yours!
Feyther paid for the space, and put up all the fixtures.
If they werna named in the will, and there
is any question of my right in the matter, say, I
hae given it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the kippering shed and fixtures were named
and given to Mither and mysel&#8217;, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are yours. Let no one put you oot o&#8217; your
right. Willie will bring the feesh to you&mdash;the finest
I hae in my nets&mdash;and when they are kippered, he&#8217;ll
go to the town wi&#8217; you, and carry your basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all I need, Norman, and I am vera gratefu&#8217;
for your kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll be walking through the shed, to see that
a&#8217; is right. And if anything is beyont you, sister,
you&#8217;ll send Willie for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christine could not speak, but she put her hand
in his, and the look on her lovely face filled his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
with tears. &#8220;You are wonderfu&#8217; like Mither this
afternoon, Christine,&#8221; he said softly. And both
were silent a little while. When he spoke next, it
was of Neil&mdash;&#8220;Hae ye had a word frae the lad yet?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one, nor from the lass he married. I don&#8217;t
know what to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, it is as easy to think good, as evil. If
we dinna thing wrang, we won&#8217;t do wrang. Thinking
no evil! That is what the Good Book advises.
The puir lad was spoiled i&#8217; the making. If he comes
back to any o&#8217; us, he will come back to you, Christine.
There was the son, wha left his hame, in the
gospels&mdash;ye ken how he was treated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever Neil comes hame, Norman, he will
hae a loving welcome from Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The puir lad made a mistake wi&#8217; his marriage.
That is the warst of a&#8217; mistakes. No man wins o&#8217;er
it. It is the bitter drop in a&#8217; he eats and drinks,
it is the pebble in his shoe, whether he warks or
plays. Neil willna come hame till sorrow drives
him here&mdash;then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all that love can do, Norman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And call on me, if you think it needfu&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very next day Christine went to see her
mother&#8217;s customers. The idea of Nancy Baird&#8217;s
stepping into her mother&#8217;s shoes was intolerable.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not thole a thing like that! It settles the question
to me! If I didna need the money, I would
kipper the herrin&#8217;, but I&#8217;m needing the money, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
the herrin&#8217; are my lawfu&#8217; venture.&#8221; So to the
town she went, and even far exceeded her usual orders.
She was much elated by her success, and immediately
began to prepare her mother&#8217;s place for the
work before her. It caused much talk in the village,
but it prevented the Baird woman&#8217;s taking unauthorized
possession of Christine&#8217;s place in the
curing-shed.</p>
<p>Then while she was waiting and watching for the
fish, she got a letter from Cluny. He was at home
again. He was coming to Culraine on Saturday. He
would be there by noon, and he would remain in Culraine
until Monday night. She was full of joy,
and instantly began to prepare for her visitor. It
was Friday morning, and she had but little time,
but that little was enough if things went with her.
First she went to the village and asked Judith to
come and stay with her, until the following Tuesday,
and the old woman was delighted to do so.
&#8220;We will hae Cluny to oursel&#8217;s then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll tak&#8217; the house wark off your hands, Christine,
and you and Cluny can hae the time for your ain
talk and planning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And man nor woman can say nae ill word anent
Cluny visiting me, if you are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lat them say their pleasure. They&#8217;ll say naething
oot o&#8217; the way, while I am here. They ken
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I hae promised ane and all o&#8217; them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
to call a church session the first ill word I hear. I
will hae their names read out frae the pulpit&mdash;christened
name and surname&mdash;and then they will be
oot o&#8217; communion wi&#8217; the kirk, till they confess
their sin, standing up in the congregation, and asking
to be forgiven. Will ye think o&#8217; Sally Johnson,
and Kitty Brawn, and a&#8217; that crowd o&#8217; sinful
women making such a spectacle o&#8217; themsel&#8217;s! Gar!
It makes me laugh.&#8221; And she laughed, as women
of the natural order do laugh, and such laughing is
very contagious, and Christine laughed also, as she
gurgled out, &#8220;You never would do a thing like that,
Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I? Lat them try me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine wouldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldna help himsel&#8217;. It is in the &#8216;Ordering
o&#8217; the Kirk.&#8217; He wad be forced to call the session,
and I wouldn&#8217;t won&#8217;ner if he rayther liked
the jarring occasion. He dislikes insulting women,
and why shouldn&#8217;t he like to gie them a galling withstanding.
It wad be vera desirable i&#8217; my opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cluny had said, in his letter, that his next voyage
would be the last before their marriage, and that
he would have to sweeten the next half year with
the memories of his coming visit. So Christine
killed her young, plump, spring chickens, and saved
all her eggs, and provided every good thing she
could for her expected lover.</p>
<p>The next three days were days taken out of this
work-a-day world, and planted in Paradise. Everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
appeared to unite to make them so. Judith
looked after the house, the lovers wandered in the
hill side garden. They were lovely days, green,
shot with gold, and the whole sweet place was a
caress of scent. The roses in Margot&#8217;s garden were
in their first spring beauty, and the soul of a white
jasmine vine, that surrounded the spot, breathed
of heaven. The larkspurs stood around like watchful
grenadiers. Lilies and pansies were at their
feet, and the laburnum hung its golden droops above
them. All the day long, the sea was blue and calm,
and the waves seemed to roll themselves asleep upon
the shore. At night, there was a full moon above
the water, and in its light the projecting rigging of
some ships lying on it looked like spider webs on
the gray firmament. The sun, and the moon, and
the sea were all new, and the whole world was
their own.</p>
<p>Talk of their marriage no longer made trouble,
for Christine now sweetly echoed his hopes and his
dreams. She had said &#8220;on the fifteenth of next
April, or there-abouts,&#8221; and Cluny seized and clung
to the positive date. &#8220;Let it be the fifteenth,&#8221; he
decided. &#8220;I cannot bear &#8216;there-abouts,&#8217; or any other
uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fifteenth might fall on a Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let it be Sunday. There can be no better
day;&#8221; and Christine smiled and lifted her beautiful
face, and he wanted to give her a thousand
kisses. For nearly three days all the ancient ecstasies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
of love and youth were theirs. I need say no more.
The morning redness of life and love has once
tinged us all.</p>
<p>Judith went home the following day. Nothing
less than the joys and sorrows and contentions of
the whole village, were sufficient for her troubled and
troubling spirit. Judith had everyone&#8217;s affairs to
look after, but she gave the supremacy of her attention
to Cluny and Christine. Christine, she said,
was a by-ordinary girl. She had written a poem,
and got gude siller for it, and there wasna anither
lass in Culraine, no, nor i&#8217; the hale o&#8217; Scotland, could
do the same thing.</p>
<p>Christine&#8217;s first employment was to put her house
in perfect order, then she took out her old fisher
dresses, and selected one for the work before her.
She hoped that her effort to take her mother&#8217;s place
in the kippering shed would put a stop to the fisherwives&#8217;
opinion that she was &#8220;setting hersel&#8217; up aboon
them a&#8217;.&#8221; She longed for their good will, and she
had no desire whatever to &#8220;tak&#8217; her mither&#8217;s outstanding
place,&#8221; a fear of which intention some of
the older women professed.</p>
<p>Her first visitor was her brother Norman. He
put a stop at once to all her good and kind intentions.
&#8220;You mustna go near the kippering,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I hae heard what must put a stop to that intent.
The herrin&#8217; are near by, and may be here tonight.
If so be, I will send my lad, Willie, to the foot o&#8217;
the hill wi&#8217; your feesh, by five o&#8217;clock in the morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
He will carry your basket easy, and do your
bidding in a&#8217; things. Gae yer ways to the town,
and cry your feesh, and you&#8217;ll hae the siller in your
hand when you come hame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can I not kipper my fish, Norman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isna worth while tellin&#8217; ye. God alone understands
quarrelsome women, but if you go to the
kippering-shed, there will be trouble&mdash;and trouble
for me, Christine&mdash;for Jessy is in wi&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do as you tell me, Norman. Hae the fish
ready at six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Norman went away, and Christine put back
in its place the kippering suit, and took out her very
prettiest selling suit. For her mourning dress
touched only her domestic and social life, her business
had its own dress, and the fisher dress was
part of the business. She had no sense of humiliation
in assuming it, nor yet in the selling of the
fish. She had liked very well the little gossip with
known householders, and had not been offended by
the compliments she received from strangers and
passersby. The first morning of this new season
was really a little triumph. All her old friends
wanted to hear about Margot&#8217;s sickness and death,
and when her basket was empty, she sent Willie
home and stayed with an old friend of her mother&#8217;s,
and had a cup of tea and a fried herring with her.</p>
<p>They had much to talk about, and Christine resolved
to stay with her until the mail should come
in, which would be about eleven o&#8217;clock. Then if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
there was any letter for her, she could get it at
once. &#8220;The Domine is aye thoughtless anent the
mail,&#8221; she reflected, and then with a little laugh
added, &#8220;he hasna any love letters coming, or he
would be thinking on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She received two letters. One was a letter from
Cluny, mailed at Moville, Ireland. The other was
from Blackwood&#8217;s Publishing House, offering her
a hundred and fifty pounds advance, and ten per
cent royalty for her novel, or, if she preferred it,
three hundred and fifty pounds for all rights. She
went to the Domine with this letter, and he advised
her to accept three hundred and fifty pounds for
all rights. &#8220;You will be requiring bride-dresses,
and house-napery of many kinds,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and, my
dear girl, God has sent you this check. He knew
you would have need of these things. You ought
to be very happy in this thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, Sir. You know how &#8216;just enough&#8217; has been
my daily bread; and I was worrying a little about
wedding garments, and expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Christine, of all life&#8217;s fare, God&#8217;s daily
bread is best. Answer your letter here, and I will
mail it for you. In a few days you will have plenty
of money. Go at once, and put it in the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, Sir. And when I get home, I will begin
another book at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go with the fish, until you have the money in
your hand. Things unforeseen might happen to
delay payment. Good Fortune does not like us to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
be too sure of her. I have seen her change her
mind in that case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are always right, Sir. I will do as you
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In three days you may expect the money. Do
your work as if you were not expecting it. Miss
nothing of your duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Christine went the second morning, and
had extraordinary success. Among the &#8220;Quality
Houses&#8221; they were watching for her. They had
never before seen such fine, and such fresh fish.
They would have no others. She went home with
her little purse full of silver, and her heart singing
within her. It was not, after all, so bad to be
a fisher-girl. If it was all small money, it was all
ready money. And the people who had known her
mother had remembered her, and spoken kindly of
her, and Christine loved them for it. She had not
yet forgotten. Oh no! Many times in the day
and night she cried softly, &#8220;Mither! Mither!
Where are ye? Dinna forget Christine!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the third morning she had a little adventure.
She was delaying, for she was waiting for the mail,
and had taken a cup of tea with her mother&#8217;s old
friend. She stood in the doorway talking, and
Christine was on the sidewalk, at the foot of the
steps. Her empty basket was at her feet. She
stood beside it, and the sunshine fell all over her.
Its searching light revealed nothing but a perfection
of form, a loveliness of face, and a charm of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
manner, that defied all adverse criticism. She looked
as the women of that elder world, who were the
mothers of godlike heroes, must have looked.</p>
<p>Suddenly her friend ceased her conversation, and
in a low hurried voice said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes the young master, and his bride!
Look at them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Christine turned her face to the street, and
as she did so, a carriage passed slowly, and Angus
Ballister looked at her with an unmistakable intention.
It was a stern, contemptuous gaze, that shocked
Christine. She could make no response but sheer
amazement, and when the carriage had passed it required
all her strength to say a steady &#8220;good-morning&#8221;
to her friend, and hurry down the road homeward.
Not then, and there, would she think of the
insult. She put it passionately beneath the surface,
until she reached her home, and had locked herself
within its shelter. Then, she gave way utterly to her
chagrin and sorrow, and wounded pride, and wept
such bitter, cruel tears, as no other sorrow had ever
caused her. She wept like a wounded child, who
knows it has been cruelly treated, who comprehends
the injustice of its pain and its own inability to defend
itself, and finds no friend or helper in its suffering.</p>
<p>Finally, when perfectly exhausted, she fell asleep
and slept till the sun set and the shadows of the
night were on sea and land. Then she arose, washed
her tear-stained face, and made her tea. In her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
sleep she had been counseled and comforted, and
she looked at the circumstance now with clear eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got just what I deserved,&#8221; she said bluntly to
herself. &#8220;Why did I go to the fishing at all? I
wasna sent there. God took me awa&#8217; from the
fishing, and showed me what to do, just as He took
King David from the sheep-cotes, and made him a
soldier. If David had feared and doubted, and
gone back to the sheep-cotes, he wouldna hae been
King o&#8217; Israel. Weel, when God took the nets out
o&#8217; my hands, and told me to sing, I got feared singing
and story-telling wouldna feed me, and I went
back to the nets. Now then, Christine, thank God
for the snubbing you got. Yesterday I knew money
was coming, plenty o&#8217; it. Why didn&#8217;t I sit still or
go to the wark He wants me to do. Why? Weel,
if I must tell the bottom truth, I rayther fancied
mysel&#8217; in my fisher dress. I was pleased wi&#8217; the
admiration I got baith frae the men and the women.
Something else, Christine? Ay, my Conscience, if
I be to tell all, I liked the gossip o&#8217; the women&mdash;also
the pride I had in my ain strength and beauty,
and the power it gave me o&#8217;er baith men and women&mdash;ay,
and I liked to mak&#8217; the siller in my ain
fingers, as it were&mdash;to say to folk, &#8216;here&#8217;s your fish,&#8217;
and then feel their siller in the palm o&#8217; my hand.
I was wrang. I was vera wrang. I wad be served
as I deserve, if thae book people went back on their
word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just here the Domine and Jamie came, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
Domine had the letter with the money in it. Then
he noticed that she had been crying, and he asked,
&#8220;Who has been hurting you, Christine?&#8221; and she
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mysel&#8217;, Sir. I hae been hurting mysel&#8217;.&#8221; Then
while he drank a cup of tea, she told him the little
circumstance, which even yet made her draw her
shoulders together, with a gasp of bitter chagrin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine, you will remember that I told you
it was they who waited patiently on the Lord, who
received His blessing. Are you satisfied now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Sir! Do not ask me that question. You
know I am satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then put this money in the bank, and go to
wark with all your mind, and all your soul. Being
a woman you cannot preach, so God has chosen
you for the pen of a ready writer. Say all that is
given you to say, whether you get paid by the handicrafters,
or not. God will see that you get your
wages. Goodnight! You may let the bit Ballister
affair slip out of your mind. The young man isn&#8217;t
naturally bad. He is ashamed of himself by this
time. No doubt of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>These things happened at the beginning of the
herring season, and for two months Christine had
a blessed interval of forgetfulness. Every man,
woman and child, was busy about the fish. They
had no time to think of the lonely girl, who had
begun, and then suddenly abandoned the fishing&mdash;nobody
knew what for. But they saw her in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
kirk every Sabbath, apparently well and happy, and
old Judith said she had nae doubt whatever that
Cluny had forbidden her to hae any pairt in the
clash and quarreling o&#8217; the women folk in the herrin&#8217;
sheds, and why not? Cluny would be a full captain,
wi&#8217; all his trimmings on, when he came to Culraine
next April for his wife, and was it likely he would
be wanting his wife cryin&#8217; feesh, and haggling wi&#8217;
dirty, clackin&#8217; women, for a few bawbees? Christine
was a lady born, she said, and her Cluny would
set her among the quality where she belonged.
Judith had no doubt whatever that Christine was
obeying an order from Cluny, and Jessy Ruleson
said she was glad the lass had found a master, she
had always had too much o&#8217; her ain ill way.</p>
<p>For nearly three months Christine lived a quiet,
methodical life, undisturbed by any outside influence,
and free from all care. She rose very early,
finding creative writing always easiest before noon.
She went to bed very early, knowing that the sleep
before midnight is the renewing sleep, and she
hemmed the day, night and morn, with prayer, to
keep it from unraveling. All that could happen between
these two prayers was provided for, and she
gave herself heart and soul to the delightful toil
of story-writing. She wrote as she felt. She used
the dialect and idioms of her people when it was
necessary, and no one checked her for it. It was
her style, and style is the stamp of individual intellect,
as language is the stamp of race. Certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
it is an habitual deviation from accuracy, but it is a
deviation for the purpose of communicating freedom
and feeling. The pen is neither grammar nor
dictionary, its purpose is to be the interpreter of the
heart.</p>
<p>One morning in September she had a strange feeling
of inability to work. The fog dulled her mind.
Nothing was firm and certain in her ideas. She
found herself dreaming of incoherent and mysterious
things, a woof of thought, as airy as the fog itself.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll put the paper and pencil awa&#8217;,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll build up the fire, and make some good bread,
then if I am no mair awake I&#8217;ll red up the house.
There&#8217;s dust on everything and little wonder if
there&#8217;s dust on my mind, too.&#8221; Then someone tried
to open the door and she called out, &#8220;Wait a wee!
I&#8217;ll slip the bolt in a minute.&#8221; When she had done
so, she opened the door and Neil, in a low broken
voice said, &#8220;Christine! Let me in! Why am I
bolted out?&#8221; and he whimpered out the words, like
a hurt child, as he passed her.</p>
<p>She looked at him in amazement. She could
hardly believe her own senses. This was not her
brother&mdash;a wan, trembling man, with the clothing
of a laborer, and his hair clipped close to his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bolt the door again,&#8221; he said, in his old authoritative
way, &#8220;and give me something to eat.
I am sick with hunger, and cold, and misery of all
kinds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all that, Neil, but where hae you been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
this lang time, and what makes you sae poor, and
sae broken down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get me something to eat, and I will tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she left him crouching over the fire, with his
elbows on his knees, and his face hidden in his
hands. And she asked him no more questions, but
when he had had a good meal, he said, &#8220;You asked
where I had been, Christine? I hae been in prison&mdash;in
the House of Correction. I was put there by
that villain Rath, who accused me of obtaining money
under false pretenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared something of the kind. A man came
here a short time before mother died&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, going on eight months now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he cried out like some hurt animal, and
Christine hasted to say, &#8220;She left her love and her
blessing. At the very last, she spoke o&#8217; you, Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man you were speaking of, what did he
say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me for the particulars o&#8217; my loan to
you. He pitied me, and said you had a way o&#8217; getting
money on vera questionable pretenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you made no pretenses to me, that you
didna even ask me to lend you money, that I offered
it to you, and refused a&#8217; bond, or acknowledgment,
and only bid you pay me when money was easy wi&#8217;
you. And I took the liberty o&#8217; calling him a sneaking
scoundrel, and something else I&#8217;ll not say o&#8217;er
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
again. Then I wrote, and told you the entire circumstance,
and you never answered my letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never received it. Rath wanted to leave Scotland,
and the case was fairly rushed through. I was
stunned. I think I lost my senses. I did get a
lawyer, but I am sure Rath bought him. Anyway,
I lost the case, and before I realized the situation, I
found myself in prison for six months. I was made
to work&mdash;look at my hands&mdash;I had dreadful food,
dreadful companions. I was ill all the time. And
when at last I was set free, someone had claimed my
fine clothing, and left me these shameful rags.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Neil! dear Neil! Had you no money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My lawyer charged me shamefully&mdash;literally
robbed me&mdash;and I spent a great deal while in prison
in getting proper food, and any comfort I could, at
any price. After I got free, I was very ill in the
hospital, and more went, and I have only enough
left to pay my passage to America. I walked most
of the way here. I&#8217;m a broken, dying man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are naething o&#8217; the kind. All men mak&#8217;
mistakes, a good many hae a stumble on the vera
threshold o&#8217; life, and they leap to their feet again,
and go prosperously ever afterward. You hae made
a mistake, you must master it, you hae had a sair
stumble, and you are going to leap to your feet,
and run the rest o&#8217; your life-race to a clean, clear
victory. The first thing is your claes. I am going
at once to the Domine. You are about his size.
I will get a suit, and some clean linen from him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh Christine, he may tell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine betray you! What are you saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t trust anyone but you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Finlay knows my size and measure, exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vera well, then go to Finlay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I go through the town, or even the
village, in this dress? You will hae to go for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to the Domine. It is impossible for
me to go and buy a man&#8217;s full suit at Finlay&#8217;s. He
is a great talker. He wad want to ken why and
wherefore I was buying a man&#8217;s suit&mdash;you ought to
think o&#8217; this, Neil. I&#8217;ll ask Norman to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Norman will hae to tell that silly fool he married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I had better go to the Domine. He willna
cheep o&#8217; the matter to anyone. Keep the doors
bolted while I am awa&#8217;, and go to your own old
room. It is a&#8217; ready for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only half satisfied with these arrangements, he
went fretfully to bed, and Christine went as quickly
as she could to the manse. The Domine listened to
her story with an air of annoyance. &#8220;I know Neil&#8217;s
story,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he has told it as far as his
telling goes, as truthfully as I expected. I am not
so sure about his need of money, the clothing is
different. I will send over what is necessary, and
call in the afternoon and see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna be cross wi&#8217; the lad, Sir. He is sair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
broken down,&#8221; and suddenly Christine covered her
face and began to cry with almost a child&#8217;s complete
surrender to circumstances. The Domine soothed
her as he would have soothed a child, and she
said, &#8220;Forgie me, Sir, I had to give way. It is a&#8217;
by now. I&#8217;m not a crying woman, you know that,
Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, and I am the more angry at those who compel
you to seek the relief of tears. But I&#8217;ll be as
patient as I can with Neil, for your sake, and for
his father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Christine returned and Neil was difficult to
awaken, but he heard her finally, and opened the
door, in a half-asleep condition. &#8220;So the Domine refused
you?&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;I thought he would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not refuse me. He will send, or bring,
what you need, later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should hae brought them with you, Christine.
I dislike to be seen in these disreputable rags.
You should hae thought o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should, but I didna.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she cooked dinner, and he sat beside her,
and told, and retold the wrongs and sufferings he
had innocently endured. It was all Reginald Rath
he blamed, and he would not admit that his behavior
had been in any way provocative of it. &#8220;He was
furious because I married his sister, and naturally
took the management of her money into my own
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the Raths now?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I do not know. Somewhere in California, I
suspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife has a good deal of real estate there.
It was of little value when deeded to her. Its
worth has increased enormously. Rath hated the
idea of it belonging to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil, how does Roberta feel toward you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was angry as he was at first&mdash;but she loved
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you not go to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know where she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not go to California?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not money enough. Whatever set you
to writing books, Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I have been writing
books?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a review of a book by Christine Ruleson.
It praised the bit novel a good deal&mdash;Did you get
much for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They paid me vera weel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment, and then said, &#8220;Three
hundred and fifty pounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a deal of money for a book&mdash;I mean a
storybook, like a novel. I did not know writing
novels paid so well, or I would have chosen it, in
place of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine thinks writing as a profession must
choose you, that you cannot choose it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The Domine does not know everything. Have
the men who bought it paid you yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The publishers? Yes, they paid upon acceptance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you learn to write?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never learned. I just wanted to write,
and I wrote&mdash;something in me wrote. My writing
is neither here nor there. Go to your old
room, and lie down and sleep. The Domine may
think it best for you to go somewhere at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Neil went to his room but he could not sleep,
and about four o&#8217;clock the Domine called for him.
They met very coldly. The Domine had long ago
lost all interest in him as a scholar, and he resented
the way in which Neil had quietly shuffled off his
family, as soon as he supposed he had socially outgrown
them. The young man was terribly humiliated
by the necessity of appearing in his dirty,
beggarly raiment, and the Domine looked at him
with a pitying dislike. The physical uncleanliness
of Neil was repellent to the spotless purity which
was a strong note in the minister&#8217;s personality. However,
he thought of the father and mother of Neil,
and the look of aching entreaty in poor Christine&#8217;s
face quite conquered his revulsion, and he said, not
unkindly, &#8220;I am sorry to see you in such a sad
case, Neil. You will find all you need in that parcel;
go and dress yourself, and then I shall be waiting
for you.&#8221; He then turned quickly to Christine, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
Neil found himself unable to offer any excuse for his
appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Neil!&#8221; sighed Christine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, poor Neil,&#8221; answered the Domine.
&#8220;What can man do for a fellow creature, who is
incapable of being true, and hardly capable of being
false?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I advised him to go to his wife. He says she
loved him once, but turned against him at her brother&#8217;s
request.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did, and a wife who cries out has everyone&#8217;s
sympathy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will forgive him&mdash;if she loved him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She may, I have known women to go on loving
and trusting a man found out in fraud&mdash;only a
woman could do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Domine, for father&#8217;s sake&mdash;you loved father&mdash;for
his sake, be kind to poor, dispairing Neil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, child, &#8216;despairing&#8217;&mdash;that is, because he
knows he is wrong, and is not sorry for his fault. A
good man in the presence of any misfortune stands
up, feels exalted, and stretches out his arms to the
Great Friendship&mdash;he never drifts like a dismasted
ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Neil entered the room again, looking very
respectable in the new tweed suit which the Domine
had brought him. &#8220;Does it fit you, Neil?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if made for me, Sir. I thank you for it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was altered for you. Finlay knew your
measure to a quarter of an inch, he said. I told
him you were not fit to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that prudent, Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for we are going away at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to rest with Christine for a few
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you think of such a thing? Do you
want to ruin your sister as well as yourself? Do you
not know that Rath is going to sue you as soon as
your first sentence is served, for shortage in his
money account? He will keep up this prosecution,
if you stay in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do? What can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go to the United States, or Argentine,
or India, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no money to spend in travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty pounds&mdash;and a little over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H-m-m! I will lend you twenty pounds, if you
will repay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, I will repay it. I will go to New
York. I shall have a little left, when I get there,
I suppose. I shall have to travel decently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get a comfortable passage for twelve
pounds. With the balance you can make a spoon, or
spoil a horn. Many a good man has built a fine
fortune on less than forty pounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can spare fifty pounds, Sir. I will gladly
give it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You cannot spare it. You need every shilling of
it, and as I have said&mdash;fifty pounds will make a man,
or waste a man. Any Scotchman with youth, education,
and fifty pounds, feels sure of his share of
the world, or he is not worth his porridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget, Sir, that I have the bonds of a false
charge to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The charge was not false. Do what is right, in
the future, and I promise you that it shall never
more come up against you. But if you go on buying
money with life and honor, you will have a second
charge to meet. I know whereof I speak. I have
had several interviews with Mr. Rath. He is my
half-sister&#8217;s nephew. He will do anything reasonable
I ask of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! And you let me go to prison, and
blasted my good name, and made a beggar and a
wreck of me. I won&#8217;t have your help,&#8221; and he turned
to Christine, and cried out passionately, &#8220;Christine!
Christine! Save me from a friend like this! Help
me yoursel&#8217;, dear lassie! Help Neil yoursel&#8217;! For
Mither&#8217;s sake help Neil yoursel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went quickly to his side. She put her arms
round him&mdash;her white, strong, motherly arms. She
kissed his face, and wept with him, and she said
with a loving passion, all those soft, cruddling, little
sentences with which a mother soothes a hurt child.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll gie you a&#8217; the siller you want, dearie. I&#8217;ll gie
it to you as a free gift. I&#8217;ll stand by ye through
thick and thin. Guilty or not guilty, ye are my ain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
dear brither! I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re guilty! You
are feyther&#8217;s son, ye couldna be guilty. It&#8217;s a&#8217; spite,
and envy, and ill will. Mither bid me be kind to
you, and I will be kind, though all the warld&#8217;s
against me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Domine watched this scene with eyes full
of tears, and a tender fatherly look. He finally put
his elbow on the table, and rested his face in his
hand, and no doubt he was praying for counsel.
For he presently stood up, and said in a kind, familiar
voice, &#8220;Neil, we must hurry, we have a little
journey before us, if you get the next Atlantic
steamer. We will talk this matter fairly out, when
we are alone. It is cruel to force it on your sister.
She knows, and you know also, that you may safely
put your trust in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Christine left the room, and when she returned
the two men were ready to leave the house.
&#8220;Where are you taking Neil, Domine?&#8221; she asked,
in that lowered voice Fear always uses. &#8220;Where are
you taking my brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to Moville, Christine. There may be spies
watching the outgoing steamers&mdash;especially the
American Liners&mdash;so he had better go to Moville,
and take his passage from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. She bent her tearful, loving
face to Neil&#8217;s, and kissed him again, and again, and
whispered hurriedly&mdash;&#8220;Write to me often, and
soon,&#8221; and when her hand unclasped from his, she
left with him the money she had promised. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
Domine pretended not to see the loving transaction,
and the next moment the two men were wrapped up
in the thick darkness, which seemed to swallow up
even the sound of their footsteps.</p>
<p>That night Christine mingled her lonely cup of
tea with tears, but they were tears that had healing
in them. Those to whom love has caused no suffering,
have never loved. All who have loved, have
wept. Christine had given away her heart, it had
been bruised and wounded&mdash;but ought she to love
her brother less, because he had proved himself
unworthy? If anything could bring him back to her
trust, would it not be the prayers and tears born
from her desolation? To regret, and to desire, between
these two emotions the horizons recede; they
are two spiritual levers, by which the soul can work
miracles of grace.</p>
<p>So the days went on in alternating sunshine and
storm. The Domine or Jamie came every day to
see if all was well with her. Sometimes Norman
stopped long enough on an evening visit, to talk
about Neil and to wonder over his past and future.
For though he had reached New York safely,
they knew little of his life. He said he had found
a clerkship in the general store of a merchant in a
small town on the Hudson River, about sixty miles
from New York; but he intimated it was only a
resting place, till he felt ready to go to California.
His great anxiety was to obtain the knowledge of his
wife&#8217;s hiding-place, for he was sure her brother was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
determined to keep them apart. And this conviction
was gradually making a reconciliation with her
the chief aim and desire of his unhappy life. He was
sure the Domine knew where she was, and his letters
to Christine urged on her constantly a determined
effort to induce him to reveal her residence.
Christine had made three efforts to win the Domine&#8217;s
confidence, and had then abandoned the attempt
as utterly useless.</p>
<p>The herring-fishery with all its preparatory and
after duties and settlements was now quite past, and
the school was in full swing again, and the quiet
days of St. Martin&#8217;s summer were over the land.
All the magnificent flowers of early autumn were
dead, but the little purple daisy of St. Michael filled
the hedges, and the crannies of the moor. In the
garden, among the stones of its wall, the mint and
the thyme and the wall flowers still swung in sunny
hours, faint ethereal perfume; but it was like the
prayers of the dying, broken and intermittent, the
last offering of the passing autumn. There were
gray and ghostly vapors in the early morning, and
the ships went through them like spirits. The rains
sobbed at the windows, and the wind was weary of
the rain. Sometimes the wind got the best of both
fog and rain, then it filled the sails of the ships, and
with swelling canvas they strutted out with the gale.</p>
<p>In the mornings, if the sea was willing, she saw
the fishermen hastening to the boats, with their oilskins
over their arms, and water bottle swinging at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
their sides. And it was the sea after all, that was
her true companion. The everlasting hills were
not far away, but they were young compared with
the old, old, gray sea. Its murmur, its loud beat
of noisy waves, its still, small voice of mighty tides,
circling majestically around the world, all spoke
to her. Her blood ran with its tide, she wrote best
when they were inflowing. When it was high water
with the sea, it was high water with Christine&#8217;s highest
nature, spiritual and mental. Their sympathy
was perfect, and if taken away from the sea, she
would have been as miserable as a stormy petrel in
a cage. So then, with the sea spread out before
her, and her paper and pencils in hand, she hardly
missed human companionship.</p>
<p>Still there were days when she wanted to talk,
when singing did not satisfy her, and one morning
when she had watched a boat come ashore, broadside
on the rocks, she felt this need almost like a
pain in her heart. No lives had been lost, and she
had watched her brother Norman playing a godlike
act of salvation with the life-boat, yet she had
what she called &#8220;a sair heartache!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isna for the men,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;they are
a&#8217; safe, through God&#8217;s mercy, and Norman&#8217;s pluck
and courage. I think it is for the poor, poor boat,
beaten and lashed to pieces, on thae black, cruel
rocks! Poor Boatie! left alane in her misery and
death! And she did her best! Nae doubt o&#8217; that!
She did her best, and she had to die!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></div>
<p>Just then there was a knock at the door, and
though she had a moment&#8217;s wonder at anyone&#8217;s coming
up the hill, so early in such rough weather, she
cried out, &#8220;Come in. Lift the hasp, and come in.&#8221;
Then she turned round to see who would enter. It
was Roberta Ruleson.</p>

<p>Mercifully ordain that we may become aged together.&mdash;Tobit,

</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Roberta Ruleson</span> was the last person
in the world Christine expected to see. She
came in smiling, and with outstretched hand
said, &#8220;Dear Christine, tell me that you are glad to
see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nane living, Roberta, saving your ain
husband, I would be gladder to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sent the carriage away, can I stop with
you this night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can stay as long as you want to stay. I
will be gey glad o&#8217; your company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have long looked for an opportunity to come
to you. At last I pretended to be very sick with
rheumatism, and had a famous physician to see me.
Of course I had looked up the symptoms I had
to complain of, and I succeeded in deceiving him.
He was puzzled about my freedom from fever, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
I told him &#8216;it came bad enough every third day,&#8217;
and he said he would see me on the third day. My
brother and his saucy wife left for Edinburgh yesterday,
and they think I am safe in bed. I am safe
here. I left Glasgow an hour after they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you hae a cup of tea and a mouthful o&#8217;
bread and broiled ham?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am hungry and cold, and shall be very glad
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go and tak&#8217; off your bonnet and cloak,
and come to the fireside. I&#8217;ll hae the food ready
for you, in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christine wanted a few minutes to consider. Was
it right for her to tell Roberta all she knew, or must
she follow the Domine&#8217;s plan and be non-committal.
She had not satisfied herself on this subject when
Roberta returned to her, and she then hastily decided
to do right and tell the truth whatever turned
up. The tea and ham and bread were ready and
Roberta sat down to them with the pleasant eagerness
of a hungry child. She was, however, much
changed. Her face showed plainly the wear and
tear of a troubled, anxious mind, and as soon as
she had taken a long drink of tea, she asked abruptly,
&#8220;Christine, where is Neil?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then all Christine&#8217;s hesitation vanished, and she
answered frankly, &#8220;Neil is in a little town on the
Hudson River, about a two hours&#8217; journey from
New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he doing?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He is bookkeeper in a shop there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the name of the town? Tell me truly,
Christine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will let you read his last letter. It came two
days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you! It would be a great comfort to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a John Knox teapot on the chimney-piece,
and Christine lifted it down, removed the lid,
and took Neil&#8217;s letter out, and handed it to Roberta.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s invincible sense of whatever was
ridiculous or inconsistent, with a person or event, was
instantly roused by the appearance of John Knox.
She laughed with girlish merriment. &#8220;To think of
John Knox interfering in my matrimonial difficulties!&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;it is too funny! The old scold!
How grim and gruff he looks! If he could speak,
how he would rave about the outrageous authority
of women. It is refreshing to know that he had a
wife that snubbed him, and didn&#8217;t believe in him,
and did not honor and obey him, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She had unfolded the letter as she was speaking,
and now her eyes were so busy, that her tongue got
no message to deliver, and this was what she read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>My dear sister Christine</span>,</p>
<p>I am still here, waiting for the information I asked you
to get me, namely the address of my dear wife. I am unhappy,
I may say I am miserable; and I can never settle
anywhere, till I see her. If she then refuses to hear and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
believe me, life will be over to me. But she will believe
me, for I will tell her the truth, and she will see that
though I was foolish, I was not criminal. The law separating
these two conditions is far from being clear enough.
I want to know where my wife is! She will believe me!
She will trust me! You do. Mother did. Roberta has
been very near and dear to me. She has been forced to
abandon me. It is the injustice of my treatment that is
killing me. If I could only clear myself in her sight, I
could lift life again, and make the best of it. I am not half
content in this place. I cannot believe the people here are
representative Americans, and I dislike small towns. Traders
and dwellers in small towns are generally covetous&mdash;they
have a sinister arithmetic&mdash;they have no clear notions
of right and wrong, and I think they are capable of every
kind of malice known to man. I want to go to a big city,
where big motives move men, and if you do not send me
Roberta&#8217;s hiding place, I will put out for California, if I
foot it every step of the way. I am stunned, but not broken.</p>
<p class='sig1'>Your loving brother,</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Neil.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she had finished this letter, she was crying.
&#8220;Give it to me!&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;it is all about
me, Christine. Give it to me! Poor Neil! He has
been badly used! Oh Christine, what must I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to go to his side, and help him to
mak&#8217; a better life. What prevents ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh the shame of it! The atmosphere of the
prison!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You promised God to tak&#8217; him for better or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
worse, richer or poorer. You are breaking your
promise every day, and every hour, that you stay
away from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not blame me ignorantly, Christine.
My brother and I were left alone in the world,
when he was ten years old, and I was eight. He
at once assumed a tender and careful charge of my
lonely life. I cannot tell you how good and thoughtful
he was. When I left school he traveled all over
Europe with me, and he guarded my financial interests
as carefully as if they were his own. And
I gave him a great affection, and a very sincere
obedience to all his wishes and advice. At first he
seemed to favor my liking for Neil, but he soon grew
furiously jealous, and then all was very unpleasant.
Neil complained to me. He said he did not want
me to take my brother&#8217;s opinion without saying a
few words in his own behalf, and so I soon began
to take Neil&#8217;s side. Then day by day things grew
worse and worse, and partly because I liked Neil,
and partly because I was angry at Reginald, and
weary of his exacting authority, I became Neil&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was an engagement for a&#8217; the days of your
life. You hae broken it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The law excused and encouraged me to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you happy in that course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About as unhappy as I could be. I was sure
Neil had been hardly dealt with, that advantage had
been taken of his terror and grief, when he found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
himself in prison. I am sure the lawyer he employed
was really seeking Reginald&#8217;s favor, and practically
gave Neil&#8217;s case away, but I was angry at Neil&#8217;s
want of spirit and pluck, in his own defense. Reginald
told me that he cried in the dock, and I shed
a few passionate tears over his want of courage
and manliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Neil! If you had stood by him, he would
have stood by himself. Remember, Roberta, that
he was only just out of his college classes, and had
had neither time nor opportunity to make friends;
that his mither was dying, and that we had no money
to defend him; that his wife had deserted him, and
that he is naturally a man of little courage, and you
will judge him very leniently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reginald told me he was saving money in order
to run away from me, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was saving money to run awa&#8217; with, he intended
to take you with him. If he was going awa&#8217;
alone, a few pounds would hae been all he needed.
And it seems to me you were the runaway from love
and duty. But it is little matter now, who was
most to blame. Life is all repenting and beginning
again, and that is everything that can be done in
this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will start for New York tomorrow. Can you
get Doctor Trenabie here for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a distant relative both of the Raths and the
Ballisters.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He never said a word about his relationship, to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been most unlike him had he done
so, but I can tell you, he wrote me before my marriage,
and advised me to be very cautious with Mr.
Neil Ruleson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will send for him,&#8221; said Christine, a little
coldly, and then she drew the conversation towards
the Raths and Ballisters. &#8220;Were they closely connected
with Doctor Trenabie?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a distant way,&#8221; said Roberta, &#8220;but they are
firm friends, for many generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Domine does not talk much about himsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He never did. He vowed himself early in
life to chastity and poverty, for Christ&#8217;s sake, and
he has faithfully kept his vow. Old Ballister gave
him the kirk of Culraine at fifty pounds a year, and
when the death of his father made him a comparatively
rich man, he continued his humble life, and
put out all the balance of his money in loans to
poor men in a strait, or in permanent gifts, when
such are necessary. Reginald used to consider him
a saint, and many times he said that if I was married
to a good man, he would try and live such a life as
Magnus Trenabie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I knew Colonel and Angus Ballister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard Angus lately boasting about his acquaintance
with you&mdash;that is since your book has set
the whole newspaper world to praising you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is married. I saw him with his bride.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A proud, saucy, beautiful Canadian, educated in
a tip-top New York boarding school, in all the pronounced
fads of the day. Now, I have seen New
York girls of this progressive kind, and the polish
being natural to them, they were not only dashing
and impertinent, they were fascinating in all their
dictatory moods. But this kind of polish is intolerable
when laid over a hard, calculating, really puritanical
Scotch nature. Such a girl has to kill some
of her very best qualities, in order to take it on
at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She would be gey hard to live wi&#8217;. I wouldn&#8217;t
stay wi&#8217; her&mdash;not a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, I can tell you, both English and Scotch men
are enslaved easily by this new kind of girl. She
is only the girl of the period and the place, but they
imagine her to be the very latest improvement in
womanly styles. Now, I will astonish you. Reginald
married the sister of Angus Ballister&#8217;s wife.
She is equally beautiful, equally impertinent and
selfish, and she holds Reginald in a leash. She
makes fun of my dowdy dress and ways, and of my
antiquated moralities, even to my brother, in my very
presence, and Reggie looks at me critically, and then
at Sabrina&mdash;that is the creature&#8217;s name&mdash;and says&mdash;&#8216;Roberta,
you ought to get Brina to show you how
to dress, and how to behave. You should just see
Brina tread our old fogyish social laws under her
feet. She makes a sensation in every room she enters.&#8217;
And I answer pointedly&mdash;&#8216;I have no doubt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
of it.&#8217; She understands my laugh, though Reggie
is far from it. Of course she hates me, and she has
quite changed Reggie. I have no longer any brother.
I want to go and see if my husband cares for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he cares for you, more than for any
ither thing. Go to him. Mak&#8217; a man every way of
him. Teach him to trust you, and you may trust
him. Now go and sleep until the Domine comes,
and he will tak&#8217; care of your further movements.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the Domine came, he treated Roberta very
like a daughter, but he would not hear her tale of
woe over again. He said, &#8220;There are faults on
both sides. You cannot strike fire, without both
flint and steel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been so lonely and miserable, Doctor,
since I saw you last. Reggie has quite deserted me
for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Roberta, walk your lonely room with
God, and humbly dare to tell Him all your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had any suspicion of Neil, until&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roberta, women trust on all points, or are on all
points suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trusted Neil, for as you know, he was under
great obligations&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obligations! Obligations! That is a terrible
word. Love should not know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had never met Neil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You only meet the people in this life, whom you
were meant to meet. Our destiny is human, it must
come to us by human hearts and hands. Marriage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
brings out the best and the worst a man or woman
has. Let your marriage, Roberta, teach you the
height and the depth of a woman&#8217;s love. There are
faults only a woman can forgive, and go on trusting
and loving. Try and reach that height and
depth of love. Then you can go boldly to God and
say, &#8216;Forgive me my trespasses, as I have forgiven
those who trespassed against me.&#8217; What do you
want me to do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you, dear Doctor, to go and take the very
earliest passage to New York that you can get. Any
steamer and any line will do. Also I want you to
go to the bank of Scotland, and tell them to transmit
all my cash in their keeping to the bank of New
York. Also, there is a trunk at Madame Bonelle&#8217;s
I want placed on the steamer, as soon as my passage
is taken. It has a carefully chosen wardrobe in it.
Brina thought it was full of dresses to be altered,
according to American styles&#8221;&mdash;and this explanation
of the dress episode she gave to Christine with
a smile so comically illuminating, that the Doctor&#8217;s
smile perforce caught a gleam from it.</p>
<p>But he was in an authoritative mood, and he said,
&#8220;What is your intention, Mrs. Ruleson? This is a
singular order for you to give.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor, I am going to my husband. Christine
has told me where he is. He loves me yet, and I
want to go, and help, and comfort him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right. It is converting love into action.
If this is not done, love is indolent and unbelieving.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
It is not enough for Neil to love you, your love must
flow out to him in return, or your married life will
be barren as sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall forgive him everything. He is longing to
explain all to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive him before he explains. Have no explanations,
they turn to arguments, and an argument
is a more hopeless barrier than a vigorous quarrel,
or an indignant contradiction. You do not want to
judge whether he is right or wrong. The more you
judge, the less you love. Take him just as he is,
and begin your lives over again. Will you do this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roberta, you have a great work before you&mdash;the
saving of a man&mdash;the lifting of him up from despair
and ruin to confidence and hope, and success. He is
well worth your effort. Neil has fine traits, he comes
of a religiously royal ancestry, and true nobility is
virtue of race. You can save this man. Some women
could not, others would not, you can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do it, Sir, God helping me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I will go to Glasgow, and do all you require.
You must take some money with you, the
bank&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a thousand pounds in my purse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You extravagant woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money is necessary, in saving souls, Sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you. Where shall I meet you in Glasgow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Victoria Hotel&mdash;dinner at six.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></div>
<p>To these words the Doctor disappeared, and
Roberta began to amplify and explain and justify
her position and her intentions. She talked to Christine,
while Christine cooked their meals and did all
the necessary housework. She begged her to lock
the doors against all intruders, and then making herself
comfortable in the large cushioned chair by the
fireside, she took off her tight shoes, and divested
her hair of all its pads, and combs, and rats, and
with a sigh of relief said, &#8220;Now we can talk comfortably.&#8221;
They talked all day long, and they talked
of Neil. A little later, she was eager to tell Christine
all about her brother&#8217;s unaccountable marriage.
&#8220;I was really ashamed of the affair, Christine,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;No consideration for others, scarcely time
to make the wedding-dress, and I think she asked
everyone she saw to come to her marriage. She
talked the slang of every country she had visited,
and the men all thought it &#8216;so funny&#8217; when she
kicked up her dress with her heel, and treated them
to a bit of London or New York slang. The perfectly
silly and easy way in which men are caught,
and tied fast, always amazes me, Christine. It is
just like walking up to a horse&#8217;s head, with a dish
full of corn in one hand and a bridle in the other.
This little Sabrina Wales walked up to Reginald
Rath with a bit of London slang on her lips, and a
wedding ring hid in the palm of her hand, and the
poor man is her slave for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not necessarily a slave for life, Roberta.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Necessarily. No remission. No redemption.
The contract reads &#8216;until death us part.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>They discussed Sabrina from head to feet&mdash;her
hair, her eyes, her complexion, her carriage, her way
of dressing, her gowns&mdash;all short in front and long
behind&mdash;&#8220;can you guess what for, Christine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she has pretty feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has very small ones. I do not know whether
they are pretty or not. But the effect is striking, if
you watch her from the front&mdash;you can&#8217;t help thinking
of a turkey gobbler.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hours went happily enough, Christine enjoyed
them. After her paper heroine, this all-alive,
scornful, loving and hating, talking and laughing
woman was a great pleasure. Christine baked delicious
scones, and scalloped some fine oysters in
bread crumbs and chopped parsley, and made one
or two pots of Pekoe and Young Hyson tea, and
they nibbled and sipped, and talked over the whole
sacred druidical family of the Raths, even to Aunt
Agatha, who was worth half a million pounds&mdash;&#8220;which
I threw away for a good joke,&#8221; said Roberta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the clock, it is near midnight! We must
go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I have had the loveliest day. I shall
never forget it, and I will tell Neil all about it before
long. Dear Christine, I am glad you are my sister,
it lets me take nice little liberties with you; and you
know, I love you, but that is inevitable. No one can
help it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></div>
<p>When Roberta went, she seemed to take the sunshine
with her. The summer of All Saints, and the
melancholy of its long fine weather was over, and
there was the touch of winter in the frosty nights
and mornings, but for five weeks Christine heeded
nothing but her new novel. For the time being, it
fully absorbed her; and for the next few weeks she
made great progress. Then one morning Norman
came to see her. &#8220;Christine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am in
great trouble. Jessy is vera ill with scarlet fever,
and I am anxious about the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring them all here, Norman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll mebbe hinder you i&#8217; your writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is my writing worth, when the children
are in danger? Go and bring them here at once.
Get Judith to come with them. With her help I can
manage. I will come in the afternoon, and sit with
Jessy awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you willna be permitted. The doctors say
there are o&#8217;er many cases. They hae ordered the
school closed, and they are marking every house in
which there is sickness.&#8221;</p>
<p>This epidemic prostrated the village until the middle
of January, taking a death toll from the little
community, of nearly eighty, mostly women and
children. But this loss was connected with wonderful
acts of kindness, and self-denial. The men left
their boats and nursed each other&#8217;s children, the
women who were well went from house to house,
caring tenderly even for those they supposed themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
to be unfriends with. If the fever triumphed
over its victims, love triumphed over the fever. In
the Valley of the Shadow of Death, they had forgotten
everything but that they were fellow-sufferers.
Christine&#8217;s house had been a home for children without
a home, and she had spent a great part of her
time in preparing strengthening and appetizing food
for those who needed it more than any other thing.
No one, now, had a word wrong to say of Christine
Ruleson. She had been a helping and comforting
angel in their trouble, and if there had been a woman
or child more suffering and destitute than all the rest,
Christine had always taken her to her home. For
in such times of sorrow, God reveals Himself to the
heart, not to the reason. Oh, how far it is, from
knowing God, to loving Him!</p>
<p>Well, then, Sorrow may endure for a night, but
Joy cometh in the morning. And the mornings grew
to be spring mornings, full of that sunshine that
goes not only to the heart of man, but to the roots
of every green thing. The silence of the receding
hills was broken by streams glancing and dancing
down the glens. The &#8220;incalculable laughter of the
sea&#8221; was full of good promise, for those who had
been sick, and for those who had perforce been long
idle. The roar of angry billows was hushed, and
it came up to the land, hard-edged with stiff, tinkling
waves, and the convalescents rested on the
shingles beside them, taking life with every breath,
and enjoying that perfect rest that shingle knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
how to give, because it takes the shape of the sleeper,
whether he be young or old, or short or long.</p>
<p>The days were of soft, delicate radiance, the
nights full of stars. The moon in all her stages was
clear as silver, the dawns came streaming up from
the throbbing breast of the ocean. The springtime
songs were bubbling in the birds&#8217; throats, they sang
as if they never would grow old, and the honey bees
were busy among the cherry blooms, delirious with
delight.</p>
<p>Who speaks of sadness in such days?</p>
<p>Certainly Christine did not. All the troubles of
the hard winter were past, and her heart was running
over with a new joy. Cluny was coming home.
Very soon, the long waiting would be over. This
thought made her restlessly busy. Her home had to
be renovated thoroughly. Altogether twenty-eight
children had been sheltered for short or longer
periods there, and they had all left their mark on
its usually spotless walls and floors. Well, then,
they must be cleaned&mdash;and men quickly appeared
with lime and white paint, and women with soap and
scrubbing brushes. And Christine went through the
rooms, and through the rooms, with them, directing
and helping forward the beautifying work.</p>
<p>She had also to think of her wedding-dress, and
her wedding-breakfast, but these cheerful, lengthening
days gave her time for everything. When the
house pleased even her particular idea of what it
ought to be, she turned to the garden. The seeds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
of the annuals were sown, and the roses trimmed,
and not a weed left in the sacred little spot.</p>
<p>Then day after day added to all this beauty and
purity, and one happy morning Jamie brought the
letter. Cluny was in Glasgow, and his letter
was like the shout of a victor. He would
be in Culraine on Thursday&mdash;first train he could
make&mdash;they would be married Saturday morning.
Christine could not put him off any longer. He
had been waiting twenty-one years&mdash;for he had
loved her when he was only nine years old&mdash;and
he had fulfilled every obligation laid on him. And
now! Now! Now! She was his wife, his very
own! there was no one, and no circumstance, to dispute
his claim! and so on, in sentences which stumbled
over each other, because it was impossible for
humanity to invent words for feelings transcending
its comprehension.</p>
<p>Christine laughed softly and sweetly, kissed the
incoherent letter, and put it in her breast. Then she
walked through the house and garden, and found
everything as it should be. Even the dress in which
she would meet her lover, with its ribbons and ornaments,
was laid out ready to put on the next morning.
Judith was in the kitchen. The wedding dress,
and the wedding cake, would be brought home on
Friday morning.</p>
<p>However, a woman, on such an occasion, wants to
make the perfect still more perfect. She wondered
if it would not be well to go and give her last directions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
and orders that afternoon, and finally decided
to do so.</p>
<p>She was just leaving the baker&#8217;s, when Colonel
Ballister entered. He met her with respectful effusiveness,
and asked permission to walk home with
her. And as they walked to the village together,
the Colonel said, &#8220;I spent four, long, delightful
hours with Captain Macpherson last night. He is
to be here tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didna ken you was acquaint wi&#8217; him, Colonel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Henderson introduced me to him, and then
asked us both to dinner. We had a delightful three
hours at Henderson&#8217;s, then the captain and I walked
round and round the square for an hour, and we
liked each other so well, that I got permission from
him, to ask a great favor from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna see how I can favor you, Colonel, but
if I can do sae, I&#8217;ll be gey glad to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to allow me to be present at your
marriage ceremony. I shall never forget the supper
I ate with your father and mother. I respected them
both with all my heart, and I am one of the most
enthusiastic admirers of your writing, and you must
know and feel that I am your sincere friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know it, Sir. I thank you for your kind
words anent my dear feyther and mither; and I
shall be a very proud and happy girl, if you will
stand a few minutes by the side o&#8217; Cluny and Christine.
It will be for our honor and pleasure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Macpherson asked me to call and see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
him, and I will then find out your arrangements, and
very proudly drop into them.&#8221; Then he walked to
the foot of the hill with her, and could not help
noticing the school, from which at least eighty boys
and girls were issuing with a shout and a leap for
the playground. On this sight he looked pleasantly
for a few moments, and then smiling at Christine
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our enterprise! It appears to be attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not knowing just what reply to make, she smiled,
and nodded, and gave him her hand. &#8220;Good-by,
Christine! May I call you Christine? In a day or
two it will not be permissible. May I say it until
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine is my name. Call me Christine always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Macpherson would have something to
say to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? He has naething to do with my
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing he does, after you are his wife,
is to change it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can only change the family name. Every
one o&#8217; us in the family has that name. It is common
to all, far and near. Cluny can change that, and I
hae no objections; but he wouldna daur to touch a
letter of my christened name. That is my ain, as
much as my hands and my eyes are my ain&mdash;ay, and
a gey bit mair sae&mdash;for a man may claim the wark o&#8217;
your hands, and the glint o&#8217; your e&#8217;en, but he canna
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
mak&#8217; use o&#8217; your name. It is o&#8217;er near forgery&mdash;and
punishment. Sae I am Christine to yoursel&#8217; neither
for wark, nor for use, but just for pure honest
friendship&mdash;Christine, as lang as we baith wish it
sae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Christine. I am proud of the
favor!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I am beggared for words, when I come to
try any description of Cluny&#8217;s wonderful joy in the
final fruition of his long-delayed hopes. When he
landed, he was at first volubly happy. He told
everyone he was going to be married. He expected
everyone to rejoice with him. All his thoughts,
words, and actions were tinctured with Christine.
Men looked at him, and listened to him, with pity
or envy, and one of the greatest of Glasgow&#8217;s mercantile
magnates cried out enviously&mdash;&#8220;Oh, man!
Man! I would gie all I possess to be as divinely
mad as you are&mdash;just for one twenty-four hours!&#8221;</p>
<p>But joy at its very deepest and holiest turns
strangely silent. The words it needs have not yet
been invented, and when Cluny was free of all duty,
and could come to the very presence of his Beloved,
he could say nothing but her name, &#8220;Christine!
Christine!&#8221; almost in a whisper&mdash;and then a pause,
a pause whose silence was sweeter far than any words
could have been. Speech came later, in passionate
terms of long and faithful love, in wonder at her
beauty, ten-fold finer than ever, in admiration of her
lovely dress, her softer speech, her gentler manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
She was a Christine mentalized by her reading and
writing, and spiritualized by her contact with the
sick and suffering little children of the past months.
Also, love purifies the heart it burns in.</p>
<p>Everything was ready for the marriage, and it
was solemnized on Saturday morning in the Ruleson
home. The large living room was a bower of fresh
green things, and made gay and sweet with the first
spring flowers. The marriage table was laid there
also, but the Domine stood on the hearthstone, and
on the very altar of the home in which Christine had
grown to such a lovely and perfect womanhood,
she became the wife of Captain Cluny Macpherson.</p>
<p>That day when Cluny came in to the bridal, he
wore for the very first time his uniform as captain of
the new steamer just finishing for him. For he had
asked one great favor for himself, which was readily
granted, namely, that his commission as captain be
dated on his wedding day. So then he received his
wife and his ship at the same time. The room
was crowded with men and women who had known
him from boyhood, and when he appeared, it was
hard work to refrain from greeting him with a shout
of &#8220;Welcome, Captain!&#8221; But it was the light of joy
and admiration in Christine&#8217;s face, which repaid him
for the long years of working and waiting for this
gloriously compensating hour.</p>
<p>The Colonel said he had the honor of assisting at
the wedding of the handsomest couple in Scotland.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
And it was not altogether an exaggeration. Christine
in her white satin gown, with white rose buds
in her golden hair, and on her breast&mdash;tender, intelligent,
intensely womanly was the very mate&mdash;in
difference&mdash;for Cluny, whose sea-beaten beauty, and
splendid manhood were so fittingly emphasized by
the gold bands and lace and buttons, which Jamie
had once called &#8220;his trimmings.&#8221; He wore them
now with becoming dignity, for he knew their value,
because he had paid their price.</p>
<p>There was a crowded breakfast table after the
ceremony. The Domine blessed the meal, and the
Colonel made a flattering speech to the people of
Culraine&mdash;his people&mdash;he called them; promising
them better water, and better sanitary arrangements,
and another teacher who would look especially after
the boys&#8217; athletic games and exercises. During this
speech the Captain and his bride slipped away to the
train, in the Colonel&#8217;s carriage, and when it returned
for the Colonel, the wedding guests were scattering,
and the long-looked-for event was over.</p>
<p>Over to the public, but to the newly-wed couple
it was just beginning. To them, the long, silent
strings of hitherto meaningless life, were thrilling
with strange and overwhelming melodies. Marriage
had instantly given a new meaning to both lives. For
the key to life is in the heart, not in the brain; and
marriage is the mystical blending of two souls, when
self is lost, and found again in the being of another.
It was with them,</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>That ever working miracle of God,</p>
<p>The green and vital mystery of love,</p>
<p>Still budding in the garden of the heart.</p>
</div></div>
<p>The wedding festivities over, all excitement about
it quickly subsided. Christine would be sure to
come back again, Cluny would return at stated
periods, and always bring with him the air and flavor
of lands strange and far off. Their farewells would
always be short ones. Their presence would always
be a benefaction. There was nothing to discuss, or
wonder over, and the preparations for the herring
season were far behind-hand. They could talk about
the wedding later, at present the nets and the boats
were the great anxiety in every house in the village.
So Christine and Cluny with little observation,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Sailed happily into the future,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Wherever their wishes inclined them;</p>
<p>Love and Good Fortune as shipmates,</p>

</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Not</span> long before the breaking out of the present
European war, I was in London, and
needed a typist, so I went to a proper Intelligence
Office on the Strand, and left a request
directing them to send any likely applicant to my
hotel for a conversation. On the next afternoon I
heard a woman&#8217;s voice in an altercation with the bellboy.
I opened the door, and the boy said he could
not quite make out the lady; he was very sorry indeed,
but the lady would not explain; and so forth.</p>
<p>The lady looked at the premature little man with
contempt, and said a few passionate words of such
unmistakable Scotch, that I felt the bellboy to be
well within the pale of excusable ignorance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you from the Intelligence Office?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Madam. At the request of Scott and Lubbock
I came to see you about copying a novel.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Come in then,&#8221; and as soon as the door was
closed, I offered my hand, and said only one word&mdash;&#8220;Fife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; she answered proudly, &#8220;Fife! I can speak
good English, but the stupid lad made me angry, and
then I hae to tak&#8217; to the Scotch. I don&#8217;t hae the English
words to quarrel wi&#8217;, and indeed if you want a
few words of that kind, the Scotch words hae a tang
in them that stings like a nettle, even if folk cannot
quite make out the lady or gentleman that uses
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not help laughing. &#8220;What words did you
use?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naething oot o&#8217; the way, I just told him, in a
ceevil manner, that he was a feckless, fashious gowk,
or something or ither o&#8217; an idiotic make. He was
just telling me he didn&#8217;t speak French, when you
opened the door,&#8221; and then she laughed in a very
infectious manner. &#8220;But this is not business,
Madam,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I will be glad to hear what
you require.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our business was soon pleasantly arranged, and
just then, very opportunely, my five o&#8217;clock tea came
in, and I asked Miss Sarah Lochrigg to stay, and
drink a cup with me, and tell me all about the Scotland
of her day. &#8220;It is fifty years since I left Scotland,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;there will be many changes since
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took off her hat and gloves and sat down. &#8220;I
come from a fishing village on the coast of Fife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
They don&#8217;t change easily, or quickly, in a fishing village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What village? Was it Largo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Culraine, a bit north of Largo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Culraine. Do you know the place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to know people who lived there. Doctor
Magnus Trenabie, for instance. Is he living
yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he went the way of the righteous, twenty
years ago. I remember him very well. He preached
until the last day of his life, but he was so weak,
and his eyesight so bad, that one of the elders helped
him up the pulpit stairs, and another went up at the
close of the service, and helped him down, and saw
him safely home.</p>
<p>&#8220;One Sabbath morning, though he made no complaint,
he found it difficult to pronounce the benediction,
but with a great effort he raised his hands and
face heavenward, and said every word plainly. Then
he turned his face to the elder, and said, &#8216;Help me
home, Ruleson,&#8217; and both Ruleson and Tamsen took
him there. He died sometime in the afternoon,
while the whole kirk was praying for him, died so
quietly, it was hard to tell the very time o&#8217; his flitting.
He was here one minute, the next he was gone. In
every cottage there was the feeling of death. He
was really a rich man, and left a deal of money to
the Ruleson school in Culraine village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Norman Ruleson is yet alive?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but his wearisome wife fretted herself into
a-grave a good many years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other Ruleson boys? Are they all alive
yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell. They were all great wanderers.
Do you remember old Judith Macpherson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, her grandson married the only girl Ruleson,
and they have ruled Culraine ever since I can
remember. The Captain was very masterful, and
after he was &#8216;retired,&#8217; that was after he was sixty, I
think, he lived at Culraine, and Culraine lived as
much to his order as if they were the crew of his
ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did they live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the old house, but they built large rooms
round about it, and put on another story above all
the rooms. They made no change in the old part
of the house, except to lift the roof, and insert modern
widows. The new rooms were finely papered
and painted and furnished, the old living room is still
whitewashed, and its uncarpeted floor is regularly
scrubbed and sanded. The big hearthstone has no
rug to it, and the rack against the wall is yet full of
the old china that Mrs. Macpherson&#8217;s mother used.
All the Macpherson boys and girls were married in
that room, just in front of the hearthstone, or on it.
I do not remember which. The Captain&#8217;s wife insisted
on that part of the ceremony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know the Captain&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In a general way, only. She is very well known.
She writes books&mdash;novels, and poems, and things
like that. Some people admire them very much,
most of our folks thought them &#8216;just so-so.&#8217; I can&#8217;t
say I ever read any of them. My mother believed
all books but the Bible doubtful. Domine Trenabie
read them, and if you wanted Captain Macpherson&#8217;s
good will, you had to read them&mdash;at least, I have
heard that said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she writing books yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, she had one on the market last year. She
did not write much while her children were growing
up&mdash;how could she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many children has she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think eleven. I believe one died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you telling me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth, all the truth, nothing but the truth.
She has seven sons, and five girls. The youngest
girl died, I heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is older than I am. Does she look older?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. She looks younger. Her hair is thinner, as
I can remember it, but pretty and bright, and always
well dressed. I have seen her in her fisher&#8217;s cap in
the morning. In the afternoon she wears a rose and
a ruffle of white lace, which she calls a cap. Her
gowns are long and handsome, and she has beautiful
laces, but I never saw any jewelry on her. Colonel
Ballister gave her a necklace of small, but exceedingly
fine India pearls, but nobody ever saw it on her
neck. Perhaps she did not like to put them on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
People said he bought them for the girl he hoped
to marry when he returned home. She married
someone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. She made a great mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, young Angus Ballister made a mistake,
too. His wife wouldn&#8217;t live anywhere but in Paris,
until the estate was like a moth-eaten garment. They
had to come home, and she fretted then for California,
but there wasn&#8217;t money for anywhere but just
Ballister. Mebbe there was some double work about
the affair, for I ne&#8217;er heard tell of any scrimping
in Ballister Mansion, and when he came to Culraine
he was free as ever with his siller and his
promises&mdash;and he kept his promises, though some
of them were the vera height of foolishness. He
was thick as thack with the Macphersons, and
the Captain and himsel&#8217; spent long days in Macpherson&#8217;s
boat, laying out, and pretending to
fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why &#8216;pretending&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They never caught anything, if it wasn&#8217;t a haddock
or a flounder, when the water was crowded
with them, and when, as little Bruce Brodie said,
&#8216;the feesh were jumping into the boat, out o&#8217; each
other&#8217;s way.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear anything of Neil Ruleson, who
was a lawyer and went to America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never until I was a full-grown lassie. Then they
came to pay a visit to Mrs. Macpherson. They are
very rich. They have money, and houses, and land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
beyond all likelihood, and just one sickly son to heir
it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil Ruleson&#8217;s wife was the sister of a Mr. Reginald
Rath. Do you remember anything of the
Raths?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little. Rath and Ballister married sisters.
Rath&#8217;s wife died in Rome, of fever. They had no
children, and Rath went to Africa with General Gordon.
I do not think he ever came back, for I heard
my brother reading in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>, that the
two claimants to the Rath estate were likely to come
to an agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were silent for a few moments, and then I
said, &#8220;There is one more person I would like to hear
of. He was only a lad, when I knew him, but a very
promising one, a grandson of old James Ruleson,
and called after him, though adopted by the
Domine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know who you mean, though he is now called
Trenabie. There was something in the way of the
law, that made it right and best for him to take his
adopted father&#8217;s name, if he was to heir his property
without trouble. The Rulesons thought it fair, and
made no opposition, and the lad loved the Domine,
and liked to be called after him. So he was ordained
under the name of Trenabie, and is known all over
England and Scotland as Doctor James Trenabie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why James? The Domine&#8217;s name was Magnus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would not have his Christian name changed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
He said he would rather lose ten fortunes, than
touch a letter of his name. James had been solemnly
given him in the kirk, and so written down
in the Kirk Book, and he hoped in God&#8217;s Book also,
and he believed it would be against his calling and
salvation to alter it. Folks thought it was very
grand in him, but his Aunt Christine was no doubt
at the bottom o&#8217; his stubbornness. For that matter
he minds her yet, as obedient as if he was her bairn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he got the Domine&#8217;s money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lion&#8217;s share. The village and school of Culraine
got a good slice of it, and King&#8217;s College, Aberdeen,
another slice, but Jamie Ruleson got the lion&#8217;s
share. He married the daughter of the Greek Professor
in King&#8217;s, and their first child was a laddie,
who was called Magnus. Some are saying that his
preaching isna quite orthodox, but rich and poor
crowd any church he speaks in, and if you are going
to Glasgow, you will hardly be let awa&#8217; without hearing
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This one and that one will be asking you, &#8216;Have
you heard Doctor Trenabie preach? You&#8217;ll never
think o&#8217; going awa&#8217; without hearing the man?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later I heard him. Sarah Lochrigg had
not said too much. I saw and heard a preacher by
Grace of God&mdash;no cold, logical word-sifter, but a
prophet inspired by his own evangel. He was full
of a divine passion for heavenly things, and his
eager, faithful words were illuminated by mystic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
flashes, just as a dark night is sometimes made wonderful
by flashes of electricity. The subject of his
sermon was &#8220;Our Immortality&#8221; and his first proposition
startled me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before asking if a man has a future life, let us
ask, &#8216;is he living now?&#8217; The narrow gateway to the
cities not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,
is Conscience! If there is no Conscience, is there
any soul?&#8221; From this opening he reasoned of life,
death and eternity, with that passionate stress of
spirit which we owe entirely to Christianity. The
building seemed on fire, and it was difficult even for
the reticent Scot to restrain the vehement, impetuous
cry of the jailer at old Philippi&mdash;&#8220;What shall I do
to be saved?&#8221;</p>
<p>Physically, his appearance was one well-fitting a
Man of God. He looked worthy of the name. He
was tall, and slenderly built, and when some divinely
gracious promise fell from his lips, his face broke
up as if there were music in it. He had the massive
chin, firm mouth and large, thoughtful gray eyes of
his grandfather Ruleson, and the classical air of a
thoroughbred ecclesiastic that had distinguished
Doctor Trenabie. Surely the two men who so loved
him on earth hear the angels speak of him in heaven,
and are satisfied.</p>
<p>It was a coincidence that on the following morning,
I found, in a Scotch magazine, three verses by
his Aunt Christine. In the present stressful time of
war and death, they cannot be inappropriate, and at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
any rate, they must have been among the last dominant
thoughts of my heroine. We may easily imagine
her, sitting at the open door of the large room
which gave her such a wide outlook over the sea, and
such a neighborly presence of the village, watching
the ghost-like ships in the moonlight, and setting the
simple lines either to the everlasting beat of noisy
waves, or the still small voice of mighty tides circling
majestically around the world:</p>
<h3>WHEN THE TIDE GOES OUT</h3>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Full white moon upon a waste of ocean,</p>
<p class='indent2'>High full tide upon the sandy shore,</p>
<p>In the fisher&#8217;s cot without a motion,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Waiteth he that never shall sail more.</p>
<p>Waiteth he, and one sad comrade sighing,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Speaking lowly, says, &#8220;Without a doubt</p>
<p>He will rest soon. Some One calls the dying,</p>
<p class='indent14'>When the tide goes out.&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Some One calls the tide, when in its flowing,</p>
<p class='indent2'>It hath touched the limits of its bound;</p>
<p>Some great Voice, and all the billows knowing</p>
<p class='indent2'>What omnipotence is in that sound,</p>
<p>Hasten back to ocean, none delaying</p>
<p class='indent2'>For man&#8217;s profit, pleasuring or doubt,</p>
<p>Backward to their source, not one wave straying,</p>
<p class='indent14'>And the tide is out.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Some One calls the soul o&#8217;er life&#8217;s dark ocean,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When its tide breaks high upon the land,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span></p>
<p>And it listens with such glad emotion,</p>
<p class='indent2'>As the &#8220;called&#8221; alone can understand.</p>
<p>Listens, hastens, to its source of being,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Leaves the sands of Time without a doubt;</p>
<p>While we sadly wait, as yet but seeing</p>
<p class='indent14'>That the tide is out.</p>
</div></div>
<p>This was my last message from Christine. For a
few years she had sent me a paper or magazine containing
a poem or story she thought I would like.
Then Sarah Lochrigg sent me a Glasgow paper, with
a sorrowful notice of her death in it, declaring that
&#8220;it could hardly be called death. She just stepped
from this life, into the next.&#8221; Sarah, in a later letter,
added she had been busy in her house all morning
and as cheerful and interested about the coming
spring cleaning as if she was only twenty years old.
About fifteen minutes before twelve she said, &#8220;Now,
I am tired. I will rest awhile,&#8221; and she drew her
father&#8217;s large chair before the open door. The sea
and the boats were spread out before her and the village
lay at her feet. She could see the men fishing
and the women going about the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tide is well in,&#8221; she said to her maid, &#8220;it
will be high tide at three minutes before noon. Call
me in about half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she was left alone and I do not doubt it was
then she heard that unfathomable call, that voice
from some distant world far off yet near, and that
her soul instantly answered it. She did not leave this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
world worn out with pain and sickness. She went
without hesitation, without fear, without seeking any
human help.</p>
<p>And I tell myself that she doubtless went out with
the full tide and that some convoy of the Sea Angels
was with her, for His way is in the sea, and His path
in the great waters, and His footsteps are not known.
She died no death to mourn, for &#8220;Blessed are the
dead that die in the Lord!&#8221;</p>
